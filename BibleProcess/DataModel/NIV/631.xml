    <verse value="1">My son, do not forget my teaching, but keep my commands in your heart, </verse>
    <verse value="2"> for they will prolong your life many years and bring you prosperity.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; </verse>
    <verse value="6"> in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and shun evil. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> This will bring health to your body and nourishment to your bones.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Honor the LORD with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your crops;</verse>
    <verse value="10"> then your barns will be filled to overflowing, and your vats will brim over with new wine.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> My son, do not despise the LORD's discipline and do not resent his rebuke, </verse>
    <verse value="12"> because the LORD disciplines those he loves, as a father the son he delights in.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, the man who gains understanding,</verse>
    <verse value="14"> for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> She is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire can compare with her.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> Her ways are pleasant ways, and all her paths are peace. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who lay hold of her will be blessed.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> By wisdom the LORD laid the earth's foundations, by understanding he set the heavens in place; </verse>
    <verse value="20"> by his knowledge the deeps were divided, and the clouds let drop the dew.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> My son, preserve sound judgment and discernment, do not let them out of your sight; </verse>
    <verse value="22"> they will be life for you, an ornament to grace your neck. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> Then you will go on your way in safety, and your foot will not stumble; </verse>
    <verse value="24"> when you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> Have no fear of sudden disaster or of the ruin that overtakes the wicked,</verse>
    <verse value="26"> for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being snared.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Do not withhold good from those who deserve it, when it is in your power to act.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Do not say to your neighbor, "Come back later; I'll give it tomorrow"-- when you now have it with you.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Do not plot harm against your neighbor, who lives trustfully near you. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> Do not accuse a man for no reason-- when he has done you no harm.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> Do not envy a violent man or choose any of his ways, </verse>
    <verse value="32"> for the LORD detests a perverse man but takes the upright into his confidence.</verse>
    <verse value="33"> The LORD's curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the home of the righteous. </verse>
    <verse value="34"> He mocks proud mockers but gives grace to the humble. </verse>
    <verse value="35"> The wise inherit honor, but fools he holds up to shame.</verse>
