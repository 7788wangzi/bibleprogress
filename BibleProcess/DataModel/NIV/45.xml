    <verse value="1">Then Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants, and he cried out, "Have everyone leave my presence!" So there was no one with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> And he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard him, and Pharaoh's household heard about it. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph! Is my father still living?" But his brothers were not able to answer him, because they were terrified at his presence. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Then Joseph said to his brothers, "Come close to me." When they had done so, he said, "I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt! </verse>
    <verse value="5"> And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> For two years now there has been famine in the land, and for the next five years there will not be plowing and reaping. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> "So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God. He made me father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Now hurry back to my father and say to him, 'This is what your son Joseph says: God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; don't delay. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> You shall live in the region of Goshen and be near me--you, your children and grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and all you have. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> I will provide for you there, because five years of famine are still to come. Otherwise you and your household and all who belong to you will become destitute.'</verse>
    <verse value="12"> "You can see for yourselves, and so can my brother Benjamin, that it is really I who am speaking to you. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> Tell my father about all the honor accorded me in Egypt and about everything you have seen. And bring my father down here quickly." </verse>
    <verse value="14"> Then he threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin embraced him, weeping. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> And he kissed all his brothers and wept over them. Afterward his brothers talked with him. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> When the news reached Pharaoh's palace that Joseph's brothers had come, Pharaoh and all his officials were pleased. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Tell your brothers, 'Do this: Load your animals and return to the land of Canaan, </verse>
    <verse value="18"> and bring your father and your families back to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you can enjoy the fat of the land.' </verse>
    <verse value="19"> "You are also directed to tell them, 'Do this: Take some carts from Egypt for your children and your wives, and get your father and come. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> Never mind about your belongings, because the best of all Egypt will be yours.' " </verse>
    <verse value="21"> So the sons of Israel did this. Joseph gave them carts, as Pharaoh had commanded, and he also gave them provisions for their journey. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> To each of them he gave new clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five sets of clothes. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> And this is what he sent to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other provisions for his journey. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> Then he sent his brothers away, and as they were leaving he said to them, "Don't quarrel on the way!" </verse>
    <verse value="25"> So they went up out of Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> They told him, "Joseph is still alive! In fact, he is ruler of all Egypt." Jacob was stunned; he did not believe them. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> But when they told him everything Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the carts Joseph had sent to carry him back, the spirit of their father Jacob revived. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> And Israel said, "I'm convinced! My son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die." </verse>
