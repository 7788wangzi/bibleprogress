    <verse value="1">Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the same attitude, because he who has suffered in his body is done with sin. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> As a result, he does not live the rest of his earthly life for evil human desires, but rather for the will of God. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do--living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing and detestable idolatry. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> They think it strange that you do not plunge with them into the same flood of dissipation, and they heap abuse on you. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> But they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> For this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead, so that they might be judged according to men in regard to the body, but live according to God in regard to the spirit. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> The end of all things is near. Therefore be clear minded and self-controlled so that you can pray. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> If anyone speaks, he should do it as one speaking the very words of God. If anyone serves, he should do it with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering, as though something strange were happening to you. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> But rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal, or even as a meddler.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> For it is time for judgment to begin with the family of God; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God? </verse>
    <verse value="18"> And, "If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?" </verse>
    <verse value="19"> So then, those who suffer according to God's will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good. </verse>
