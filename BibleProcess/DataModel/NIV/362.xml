    <verse value="1">These were the divisions of the sons of Aaron: The sons of Aaron were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and they had no sons; so Eleazar and Ithamar served as the priests. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> With the help of Zadok a descendant of Eleazar and Ahimelech a descendant of Ithamar, David separated them into divisions for their appointed order of ministering. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> A larger number of leaders were found among Eleazar's descendants than among Ithamar's, and they were divided accordingly: sixteen heads of families from Eleazar's descendants and eight heads of families from Ithamar's descendants.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> They divided them impartially by drawing lots, for there were officials of the sanctuary and officials of God among the descendants of both Eleazar and Ithamar. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> The scribe Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded their names in the presence of the king and of the officials: Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar and the heads of families of the priests and of the Levites--one family being taken from Eleazar and then one from Ithamar.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> The first lot fell to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, </verse>
    <verse value="8"> the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, </verse>
    <verse value="9"> the fifth to Malkijah, the sixth to Mijamin,</verse>
    <verse value="10"> the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, </verse>
    <verse value="11"> the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,</verse>
    <verse value="12"> the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,</verse>
    <verse value="13"> the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,</verse>
    <verse value="14"> the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer, </verse>
    <verse value="15"> the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,</verse>
    <verse value="16"> the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,</verse>
    <verse value="17"> the twenty-first to Jakin, the twenty-second to Gamul,</verse>
    <verse value="18"> the twenty-third to Delaiah and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> This was their appointed order of ministering when they entered the temple of the LORD, according to the regulations prescribed for them by their forefather Aaron, as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded him.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> As for the rest of the descendants of Levi: from the sons of Amram: Shubael; from the sons of Shubael: Jehdeiah. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> As for Rehabiah, from his sons: Isshiah was the first. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> From the Izharites: Shelomoth; from the sons of Shelomoth: Jahath.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third and Jekameam the fourth. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> The son of Uzziel: Micah; from the sons of Micah: Shamir.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> The brother of Micah: Isshiah; from the sons of Isshiah: Zechariah.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The son of Jaaziah: Beno. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> The sons of Merari: from Jaaziah: Beno, Shoham, Zaccur and Ibri.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> From Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> From Kish: the son of Kish: Jerahmeel.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> And the sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder and Jerimoth. These were the Levites, according to their families.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> They also cast lots, just as their brothers the descendants of Aaron did, in the presence of King David and of Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of families of the priests and of the Levites. The families of the oldest brother were treated the same as those of the youngest. </verse>
