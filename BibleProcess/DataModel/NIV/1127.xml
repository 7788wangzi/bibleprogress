    <verse value="1">You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Endure hardship with us like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> No one serving as a soldier gets involved in civilian affairs--he wants to please his commanding officer.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Similarly, if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not receive the victor's crown unless he competes according to the rules. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel, </verse>
    <verse value="9"> for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God's word is not chained. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Here is a trustworthy saying: If we died with him, we will also live with him; </verse>
    <verse value="12"> if we endure, we will also reign with him. If we disown him, he will also disown us; </verse>
    <verse value="13"> if we are faithless, he will remain faithful, for he cannot disown himself. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> Keep reminding them of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, </verse>
    <verse value="18"> who have wandered away from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> Nevertheless, God's solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness." </verse>
    <verse value="20"> In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for noble purposes and some for ignoble. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> If a man cleanses himself from the latter, he will be an instrument for noble purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> Flee the evil desires of youth, and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> And the Lord's servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> Those who oppose him he must gently instruct, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth, </verse>
    <verse value="26"> and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will. </verse>
