    <verse value="1">A psalm of Asaph. The Mighty One, God, the LORD, speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to the place where it sets. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> From Zion, perfect in beauty, God shines forth. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Our God comes and will not be silent; a fire devours before him, and around him a tempest rages. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> He summons the heavens above, and the earth, that he may judge his people: </verse>
    <verse value="5"> "Gather to me my consecrated ones, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice." </verse>
    <verse value="6"> And the heavens proclaim his righteousness, for God himself is judge. [Selah]</verse>
    <verse value="7"> "Hear, O my people, and I will speak, O Israel, and I will testify against you: I am God, your God. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices or your burnt offerings, which are ever before me. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> I have no need of a bull from your stall or of goats from your pens, </verse>
    <verse value="10"> for every animal of the forest is mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> I know every bird in the mountains, and the creatures of the field are mine. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> If I were hungry I would not tell you, for the world is mine, and all that is in it. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Sacrifice thank offerings to God, fulfill your vows to the Most High, </verse>
    <verse value="15"> and call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will honor me."</verse>
    <verse value="16"> But to the wicked, God says: "What right have you to recite my laws or take my covenant on your lips? </verse>
    <verse value="17"> You hate my instruction and cast my words behind you. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> When you see a thief, you join with him; you throw in your lot with adulterers. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> You use your mouth for evil and harness your tongue to deceit. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> You speak continually against your brother and slander your own mother's son. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> These things you have done and I kept silent; you thought I was altogether like you. But I will rebuke you and accuse you to your face.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> "Consider this, you who forget God, or I will tear you to pieces, with none to rescue: </verse>
    <verse value="23"> He who sacrifices thank offerings honors me, and he prepares the way so that I may show him the salvation of God." </verse>
