    <verse value="1">For the director of music. A psalm of David. Hear me, O God, as I voice my complaint; protect my life from the threat of the enemy. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, from that noisy crowd of evildoers.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> They sharpen their tongues like swords and aim their words like deadly arrows.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> They shoot from ambush at the innocent man; they shoot at him suddenly, without fear.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> They encourage each other in evil plans, they talk about hiding their snares; they say, "Who will see them?"</verse>
    <verse value="6"> They plot injustice and say, "We have devised a perfect plan!" Surely the mind and heart of man are cunning.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> But God will shoot them with arrows; suddenly they will be struck down.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> He will turn their own tongues against them and bring them to ruin; all who see them will shake their heads in scorn.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> All mankind will fear; they will proclaim the works of God and ponder what he has done. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> Let the righteous rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in him; let all the upright in heart praise him! </verse>
