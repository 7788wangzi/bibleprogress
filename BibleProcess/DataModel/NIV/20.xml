    <verse value="1">Now Abraham moved on from there into the region of the Negev and lived between Kadesh and Shur. For a while he stayed in Gerar, </verse>
    <verse value="2"> and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, "She is my sister." Then Abimelech king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> But God came to Abimelech in a dream one night and said to him, "You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman." </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Now Abimelech had not gone near her, so he said, "Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation? </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Did he not say to me, 'She is my sister,' and didn't she also say, 'He is my brother'? I have done this with a clear conscience and clean hands." </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Now return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, you may be sure that you and all yours will die."</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Early the next morning Abimelech summoned all his officials, and when he told them all that had happened, they were very much afraid.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Then Abimelech called Abraham in and said, "What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should not be done." </verse>
    <verse value="10"> And Abimelech asked Abraham, "What was your reason for doing this?"</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Abraham replied, "I said to myself, 'There is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.' </verse>
    <verse value="12"> Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> And when God had me wander from my father's household, I said to her, 'This is how you can show your love to me: Everywhere we go, say of me, "He is my brother." ' " </verse>
    <verse value="14"> Then Abimelech brought sheep and cattle and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham, and he returned Sarah his wife to him. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> And Abimelech said, "My land is before you; live wherever you like." </verse>
    <verse value="16"> To Sarah he said, "I am giving your brother a thousand shekels of silver. This is to cover the offense against you before all who are with you; you are completely vindicated." </verse>
    <verse value="17"> Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife and his slave girls so they could have children again, </verse>
    <verse value="18"> for the LORD had closed up every womb in Abimelech's household because of Abraham's wife Sarah. </verse>
