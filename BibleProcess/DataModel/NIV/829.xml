    <verse value="3"> Say to Tyre, situated at the gateway to the sea, merchant of peoples on many coasts, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: " 'You say, O Tyre, "I am perfect in beauty." </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Your domain was on the high seas; your builders brought your beauty to perfection. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> They made all your timbers of pine trees from Senir; they took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Of oaks from Bashan they made your oars; of cypress wood from the coasts of Cyprus they made your deck, inlaid with ivory. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Fine embroidered linen from Egypt was your sail and served as your banner; your awnings were of blue and purple from the coasts of Elishah. </verse>

    <verse value="25"> " 'The ships of Tarshish serve as carriers for your wares. You are filled with heavy cargo in the heart of the sea. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> Your oarsmen take you out to the high seas. But the east wind will break you to pieces in the heart of the sea. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> Your wealth, merchandise and wares, your mariners, seamen and shipwrights, your merchants and all your soldiers, and everyone else on board will sink into the heart of the sea on the day of your shipwreck. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> The shorelands will quake when your seamen cry out. </verse>
    <verse value="29"> All who handle the oars will abandon their ships; the mariners and all the seamen will stand on the shore.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> They will raise their voice and cry bitterly over you; they will sprinkle dust on their heads and roll in ashes. </verse>
    <verse value="31"> They will shave their heads because of you and will put on sackcloth. They will weep over you with anguish of soul and with bitter mourning. </verse>
    <verse value="32"> As they wail and mourn over you, they will take up a lament concerning you: "Who was ever silenced like Tyre, surrounded by the sea?" </verse>
    <verse value="33"> When your merchandise went out on the seas, you satisfied many nations; with your great wealth and your wares you enriched the kings of the earth. </verse>
    <verse value="34"> Now you are shattered by the sea in the depths of the waters; your wares and all your company have gone down with you. </verse>
    <verse value="35"> All who live in the coastlands are appalled at you; their kings shudder with horror and their faces are distorted with fear. </verse>
    <verse value="36"> The merchants among the nations hiss at you; you have come to a horrible end and will be no more.' " </verse>
