    <verse value="1">For the director of music. A psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they display knowledge.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens he has pitched a tent for the sun,</verse>
    <verse value="5"> which is like a bridegroom coming forth from his pavilion, like a champion rejoicing to run his course. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> It rises at one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other; nothing is hidden from its heat.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul. The statutes of the LORD are trustworthy, making wise the simple. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> The precepts of the LORD are right, giving joy to the heart. The commands of the LORD are radiant, giving light to the eyes. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever. The ordinances of the LORD are sure and altogether righteous. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> By them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Who can discern his errors? Forgive my hidden faults. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> Keep your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me. Then will I be blameless, innocent of great transgression.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer. </verse>
