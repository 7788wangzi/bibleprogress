    <verse value="1">Elihu continued:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Bear with me a little longer and I will show you that there is more to be said in God's behalf.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> I get my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe justice to my Maker. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Be assured that my words are not false; one perfect in knowledge is with you.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> "God is mighty, but does not despise men; he is mighty, and firm in his purpose. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> He does not keep the wicked alive but gives the afflicted their rights. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> He does not take his eyes off the righteous; he enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> But if men are bound in chains, held fast by cords of affliction, </verse>
    <verse value="9"> he tells them what they have done-- that they have sinned arrogantly. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> He makes them listen to correction and commands them to repent of their evil. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> If they obey and serve him, they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity and their years in contentment. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> But if they do not listen, they will perish by the sword and die without knowledge.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> "The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when he fetters them, they do not cry for help. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> They die in their youth, among male prostitutes of the shrines. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> But those who suffer he delivers in their suffering; he speaks to them in their affliction.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> "He is wooing you from the jaws of distress to a spacious place free from restriction, to the comfort of your table laden with choice food.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice have taken hold of you. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> Be careful that no one entices you by riches; do not let a large bribe turn you aside. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> Would your wealth or even all your mighty efforts sustain you so you would not be in distress? </verse>
    <verse value="20"> Do not long for the night, to drag people away from their homes. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> Beware of turning to evil, which you seem to prefer to affliction.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> "God is exalted in his power. Who is a teacher like him? </verse>
    <verse value="23"> Who has prescribed his ways for him, or said to him, 'You have done wrong'? </verse>
    <verse value="24"> Remember to extol his work, which men have praised in song. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> All mankind has seen it; men gaze on it from afar. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> How great is God--beyond our understanding! The number of his years is past finding out.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> "He draws up the drops of water, which distill as rain to the streams; </verse>
    <verse value="28"> the clouds pour down their moisture and abundant showers fall on mankind. </verse>
    <verse value="29"> Who can understand how he spreads out the clouds, how he thunders from his pavilion? </verse>
    <verse value="30"> See how he scatters his lightning about him, bathing the depths of the sea. </verse>
    <verse value="31"> This is the way he governs the nations and provides food in abundance. </verse>
    <verse value="32"> He fills his hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark.</verse>
    <verse value="33"> His thunder announces the coming storm; even the cattle make known its approach.</verse>
