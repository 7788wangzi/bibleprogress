    <verse value="1">Then Job replied to the LORD:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "I know that you can do all things; no plan of yours can be thwarted. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> [You asked,] 'Who is this that obscures my counsel without knowledge?' Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> ["You said,] 'Listen now, and I will speak; I will question you, and you shall answer me.' </verse>
    <verse value="5"> My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes."</verse>
    <verse value="7"> After the LORD had said these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "I am angry with you and your two friends, because you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has." </verse>
    <verse value="9"> So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what the LORD told them; and the LORD accepted Job's prayer. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> After Job had prayed for his friends, the LORD made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had before. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the LORD had brought upon him, and each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> The LORD blessed the latter part of Job's life more than the first. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> And he also had seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah and the third Keren-Happuch.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Job's daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> After this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> And so he died, old and full of years. </verse>
