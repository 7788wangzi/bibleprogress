    <verse value="1">For the director of music. To [the tune of] "Lilies." Of David. Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my neck.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> I sink in the miry depths, where there is no foothold. I have come into the deep waters; the floods engulf me. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> I am worn out calling for help; my throat is parched. My eyes fail, looking for my God. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Those who hate me without reason outnumber the hairs of my head; many are my enemies without cause, those who seek to destroy me. I am forced to restore what I did not steal.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> You know my folly, O God; my guilt is not hidden from you.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> May those who hope in you not be disgraced because of me, O Lord, the LORD Almighty; may those who seek you not be put to shame because of me, O God of Israel.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> For I endure scorn for your sake, and shame covers my face. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> I am a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my own mother's sons; </verse>
    <verse value="9"> for zeal for your house consumes me, and the insults of those who insult you fall on me. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> When I weep and fast, I must endure scorn; </verse>
    <verse value="11"> when I put on sackcloth, people make sport of me. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> Those who sit at the gate mock me, and I am the song of the drunkards.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> But I pray to you, O LORD, in the time of your favor; in your great love, O God, answer me with your sure salvation. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> Rescue me from the mire, do not let me sink; deliver me from those who hate me, from the deep waters. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Do not let the floodwaters engulf me or the depths swallow me up or the pit close its mouth over me.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Answer me, O LORD, out of the goodness of your love; in your great mercy turn to me. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> Do not hide your face from your servant; answer me quickly, for I am in trouble. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> Come near and rescue me; redeem me because of my foes.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> You know how I am scorned, disgraced and shamed; all my enemies are before you.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Scorn has broken my heart and has left me helpless; I looked for sympathy, but there was none, for comforters, but I found none. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> They put gall in my food and gave me vinegar for my thirst.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> May the table set before them become a snare; may it become retribution and a trap. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> Pour out your wrath on them; let your fierce anger overtake them. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> May their place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in their tents. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> For they persecute those you wound and talk about the pain of those you hurt. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> Charge them with crime upon crime; do not let them share in your salvation. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> May they be blotted out of the book of life and not be listed with the righteous.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> I am in pain and distress; may your salvation, O God, protect me.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> I will praise God's name in song and glorify him with thanksgiving. </verse>
    <verse value="31"> This will please the LORD more than an ox, more than a bull with its horns and hoofs. </verse>
    <verse value="32"> The poor will see and be glad-- you who seek God, may your hearts live! </verse>
    <verse value="33"> The LORD hears the needy and does not despise his captive people.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and all that move in them,</verse>
    <verse value="35"> for God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah. Then people will settle there and possess it; </verse>
    <verse value="36"> the children of his servants will inherit it, and those who love his name will dwell there. </verse>
