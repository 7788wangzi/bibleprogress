    <verse value="1">O LORD, the God who avenges, O God who avenges, shine forth. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> Rise up, O Judge of the earth; pay back to the proud what they deserve. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> How long will the wicked, O LORD, how long will the wicked be jubilant?</verse>
    <verse value="4"> They pour out arrogant words; all the evildoers are full of boasting.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> They crush your people, O LORD; they oppress your inheritance. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> They slay the widow and the alien; they murder the fatherless. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> They say, "The LORD does not see; the God of Jacob pays no heed."</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Take heed, you senseless ones among the people; you fools, when will you become wise? </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Does he who implanted the ear not hear? Does he who formed the eye not see? </verse>
    <verse value="10"> Does he who disciplines nations not punish? Does he who teaches man lack knowledge? </verse>
    <verse value="11"> The LORD knows the thoughts of man; he knows that they are futile.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Blessed is the man you discipline, O LORD, the man you teach from your law; </verse>
    <verse value="13"> you grant him relief from days of trouble, till a pit is dug for the wicked. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> For the LORD will not reject his people; he will never forsake his inheritance. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Judgment will again be founded on righteousness, and all the upright in heart will follow it.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will take a stand for me against evildoers?</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Unless the LORD had given me help, I would soon have dwelt in the silence of death. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> When I said, "My foot is slipping," your love, O LORD, supported me. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> When anxiety was great within me, your consolation brought joy to my soul.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Can a corrupt throne be allied with you-- one that brings on misery by its decrees? </verse>
    <verse value="21"> They band together against the righteous and condemn the innocent to death. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> But the LORD has become my fortress, and my God the rock in whom I take refuge. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> He will repay them for their sins and destroy them for their wickedness; the LORD our God will destroy them. </verse>
