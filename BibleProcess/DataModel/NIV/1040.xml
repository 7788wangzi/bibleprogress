    <verse value="1">"Brothers and fathers, listen now to my defense." </verse>
    <verse value="2"> When they heard him speak to them in Aramaic, they became very quiet. Then Paul said: </verse>
    <verse value="3"> "I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city. Under Gamaliel I was thoroughly trained in the law of our fathers and was just as zealous for God as any of you are today. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> I persecuted the followers of this Way to their death, arresting both men and women and throwing them into prison, </verse>
    <verse value="5"> as also the high priest and all the Council can testify. I even obtained letters from them to their brothers in Damascus, and went there to bring these people as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> "About noon as I came near Damascus, suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, 'Saul! Saul! Why do you persecute me?'</verse>
    <verse value="8"> " 'Who are you, Lord?' I asked. " 'I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting,' he replied. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> My companions saw the light, but they did not understand the voice of him who was speaking to me. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> " 'What shall I do, Lord?' I asked. " 'Get up,' the Lord said, 'and go into Damascus. There you will be told all that you have been assigned to do.' </verse>
    <verse value="11"> My companions led me by the hand into Damascus, because the brilliance of the light had blinded me. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> "A man named Ananias came to see me. He was a devout observer of the law and highly respected by all the Jews living there. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> He stood beside me and said, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight!' And at that very moment I was able to see him.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> "Then he said: 'The God of our fathers has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear words from his mouth. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> You will be his witness to all men of what you have seen and heard. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name.' </verse>
    <verse value="17"> "When I returned to Jerusalem and was praying at the temple, I fell into a trance </verse>
    <verse value="18"> and saw the Lord speaking. 'Quick!' he said to me. 'Leave Jerusalem immediately, because they will not accept your testimony about me.'</verse>
    <verse value="19"> " 'Lord,' I replied, 'these men know that I went from one synagogue to another to imprison and beat those who believe in you. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I stood there giving my approval and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.' </verse>
    <verse value="21"> "Then the Lord said to me, 'Go; I will send you far away to the Gentiles.' " </verse>
    <verse value="22"> The crowd listened to Paul until he said this. Then they raised their voices and shouted, "Rid the earth of him! He's not fit to live!" </verse>
    <verse value="23"> As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air, </verse>
    <verse value="24"> the commander ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks. He directed that he be flogged and questioned in order to find out why the people were shouting at him like this. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> As they stretched him out to flog him, Paul said to the centurion standing there, "Is it legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who hasn't even been found guilty?" </verse>
    <verse value="26"> When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and reported it. "What are you going to do?" he asked. "This man is a Roman citizen."</verse>
    <verse value="27"> The commander went to Paul and asked, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" "Yes, I am," he answered.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Then the commander said, "I had to pay a big price for my citizenship." "But I was born a citizen," Paul replied.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Those who were about to question him withdrew immediately. The commander himself was alarmed when he realized that he had put Paul, a Roman citizen, in chains. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> The next day, since the commander wanted to find out exactly why Paul was being accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to assemble. Then he brought Paul and had him stand before them. </verse>
