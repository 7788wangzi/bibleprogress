    <verse value="1">Then Job replied:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "I have heard many things like these; miserable comforters are you all! </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Will your long-winded speeches never end? What ails you that you keep on arguing? </verse>
    <verse value="4"> I also could speak like you, if you were in my place; I could make fine speeches against you and shake my head at you. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> But my mouth would encourage you; comfort from my lips would bring you relief.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> "Yet if I speak, my pain is not relieved; and if I refrain, it does not go away. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Surely, O God, you have worn me out; you have devastated my entire household.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> You have bound me--and it has become a witness; my gauntness rises up and testifies against me. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> God assails me and tears me in his anger and gnashes his teeth at me; my opponent fastens on me his piercing eyes. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> Men open their mouths to jeer at me; they strike my cheek in scorn and unite together against me. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> God has turned me over to evil men and thrown me into the clutches of the wicked. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> All was well with me, but he shattered me; he seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has made me his target; </verse>
    <verse value="13"> his archers surround me. Without pity, he pierces my kidneys and spills my gall on the ground. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> Again and again he bursts upon me; he rushes at me like a warrior.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> "I have sewed sackcloth over my skin and buried my brow in the dust. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> My face is red with weeping, deep shadows ring my eyes; </verse>
    <verse value="17"> yet my hands have been free of violence and my prayer is pure.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> "O earth, do not cover my blood; may my cry never be laid to rest! </verse>
    <verse value="19"> Even now my witness is in heaven; my advocate is on high. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> My intercessor is my friend as my eyes pour out tears to God; </verse>
    <verse value="21"> on behalf of a man he pleads with God as a man pleads for his friend.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> "Only a few years will pass before I go on the journey of no return.</verse>
