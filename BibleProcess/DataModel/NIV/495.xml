    <verse value="1">A prayer of David. Hear, O LORD, my righteous plea; listen to my cry. Give ear to my prayer-- it does not rise from deceitful lips. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> May my vindication come from you; may your eyes see what is right.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Though you probe my heart and examine me at night, though you test me, you will find nothing; I have resolved that my mouth will not sin.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> As for the deeds of men-- by the word of your lips I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> My steps have held to your paths; my feet have not slipped.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> I call on you, O God, for you will answer me; give ear to me and hear my prayer. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Show the wonder of your great love, you who save by your right hand those who take refuge in you from their foes. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings </verse>
    <verse value="9"> from the wicked who assail me, from my mortal enemies who surround me.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> They close up their callous hearts, and their mouths speak with arrogance. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> They have tracked me down, they now surround me, with eyes alert, to throw me to the ground. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> They are like a lion hungry for prey, like a great lion crouching in cover.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Rise up, O LORD, confront them, bring them down; rescue me from the wicked by your sword.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> O LORD, by your hand save me from such men, from men of this world whose reward is in this life. You still the hunger of those you cherish; their sons have plenty, and they store up wealth for their children.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> And I--in righteousness I will see your face; when I awake, I will be satisfied with seeing your likeness. </verse>
