    <verse value="1">Some time later Joseph was told, "Your father is ill." So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim along with him. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> When Jacob was told, "Your son Joseph has come to you," Israel rallied his strength and sat up on the bed. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and there he blessed me </verse>
    <verse value="4"> and said to me, 'I am going to make you fruitful and will increase your numbers. I will make you a community of peoples, and I will give this land as an everlasting possession to your descendants after you.' </verse>
    <verse value="5"> "Now then, your two sons born to you in Egypt before I came to you here will be reckoned as mine; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Any children born to you after them will be yours; in the territory they inherit they will be reckoned under the names of their brothers.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> As I was returning from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan while we were still on the way, a little distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath" (that is, Bethlehem). </verse>
    <verse value="8"> When Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he asked, "Who are these?" </verse>
    <verse value="9"> "They are the sons God has given me here," Joseph said to his father. Then Israel said, "Bring them to me so I may bless them." </verse>
    <verse value="10"> Now Israel's eyes were failing because of old age, and he could hardly see. So Joseph brought his sons close to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Israel said to Joseph, "I never expected to see your face again, and now God has allowed me to see your children too." </verse>
    <verse value="12"> Then Joseph removed them from Israel's knees and bowed down with his face to the ground. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> And Joseph took both of them, Ephraim on his right toward Israel's left hand and Manasseh on his left toward Israel's right hand, and brought them close to him. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> But Israel reached out his right hand and put it on Ephraim's head, though he was the younger, and crossing his arms, he put his left hand on Manasseh's head, even though Manasseh was the firstborn. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Then he blessed Joseph and said, "May the God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day, </verse>
    <verse value="16"> the Angel who has delivered me from all harm--may he bless these boys. May they be called by my name and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and may they increase greatly upon the earth."</verse>
    <verse value="17"> When Joseph saw his father placing his right hand on Ephraim's head he was displeased; so he took hold of his father's hand to move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> Joseph said to him, "No, my father, this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head." </verse>
    <verse value="19"> But his father refused and said, "I know, my son, I know. He too will become a people, and he too will become great. Nevertheless, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants will become a group of nations." </verse>
    <verse value="20"> He blessed them that day and said, "In your name will Israel pronounce this blessing: 'May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.' " So he put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> Then Israel said to Joseph, "I am about to die, but God will be with you and take you back to the land of your fathers. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> And to you, as one who is over your brothers, I give the ridge of land I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow." </verse>
