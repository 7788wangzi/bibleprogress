    <verse value="5"> saying, "When will the New Moon be over that we may sell grain, and the Sabbath be ended that we may market wheat?"-- skimping the measure, boosting the price and cheating with dishonest scales, </verse>
    <verse value="6"> buying the poor with silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, selling even the sweepings with the wheat. </verse>
