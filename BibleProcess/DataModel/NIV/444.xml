    <verse value="1">Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "How long will you say such things? Your words are a blustering wind. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?</verse>
    <verse value="4"> When your children sinned against him, he gave them over to the penalty of their sin. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> But if you will look to God and plead with the Almighty, </verse>
    <verse value="6"> if you are pure and upright, even now he will rouse himself on your behalf and restore you to your rightful place. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Your beginnings will seem humble, so prosperous will your future be.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> "Ask the former generations and find out what their fathers learned,</verse>
    <verse value="9"> for we were born only yesterday and know nothing, and our days on earth are but a shadow. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> Will they not instruct you and tell you? Will they not bring forth words from their understanding? </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Can papyrus grow tall where there is no marsh? Can reeds thrive without water? </verse>
    <verse value="12"> While still growing and uncut, they wither more quickly than grass. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> Such is the destiny of all who forget God; so perishes the hope of the godless. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> What he trusts in is fragile; what he relies on is a spider's web. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> He leans on his web, but it gives way; he clings to it, but it does not hold. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> He is like a well-watered plant in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden; </verse>
    <verse value="17"> it entwines its roots around a pile of rocks and looks for a place among the stones.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> But when it is torn from its spot, that place disowns it and says, 'I never saw you.'</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Surely its life withers away, and from the soil other plants grow.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> "Surely God does not reject a blameless man or strengthen the hands of evildoers.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> Your enemies will be clothed in shame, and the tents of the wicked will be no more."</verse>
