    <verse value="1">A psalm. A song. For the Sabbath day. It is good to praise the LORD and make music to your name, O Most High, </verse>
    <verse value="2"> to proclaim your love in the morning and your faithfulness at night, </verse>
    <verse value="3"> to the music of the ten-stringed lyre and the melody of the harp.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> For you make me glad by your deeds, O LORD; I sing for joy at the works of your hands. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> How great are your works, O LORD, how profound your thoughts! </verse>
    <verse value="6"> The senseless man does not know, fools do not understand, </verse>
    <verse value="7"> that though the wicked spring up like grass and all evildoers flourish, they will be forever destroyed.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> But you, O LORD, are exalted forever.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> For surely your enemies, O LORD, surely your enemies will perish; all evildoers will be scattered. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> You have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox; fine oils have been poured upon me. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> My eyes have seen the defeat of my adversaries; my ears have heard the rout of my wicked foes.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> The righteous will flourish like a palm tree, they will grow like a cedar of Lebanon; </verse>
    <verse value="13"> planted in the house of the LORD, they will flourish in the courts of our God. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> They will still bear fruit in old age, they will stay fresh and green, </verse>
    <verse value="15"> proclaiming, "The LORD is upright; he is my Rock, and there is no wickedness in him." </verse>
