    <verse value="1">Then Job replied:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Even today my complaint is bitter; his hand is heavy in spite of my groaning. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> If only I knew where to find him; if only I could go to his dwelling! </verse>
    <verse value="4"> I would state my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> I would find out what he would answer me, and consider what he would say. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Would he oppose me with great power? No, he would not press charges against me. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> There an upright man could present his case before him, and I would be delivered forever from my judge.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> "But if I go to the east, he is not there; if I go to the west, I do not find him.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> When he is at work in the north, I do not see him; when he turns to the south, I catch no glimpse of him. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> But he knows the way that I take; when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> My feet have closely followed his steps; I have kept to his way without turning aside. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> I have not departed from the commands of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> "But he stands alone, and who can oppose him? He does whatever he pleases. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> He carries out his decree against me, and many such plans he still has in store. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> That is why I am terrified before him; when I think of all this, I fear him. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> Yet I am not silenced by the darkness, by the thick darkness that covers my face.</verse>
