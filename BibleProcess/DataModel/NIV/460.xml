    <verse value="1">"Why does the Almighty not set times for judgment? Why must those who know him look in vain for such days? </verse>
    <verse value="2"> Men move boundary stones; they pasture flocks they have stolen. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> They drive away the orphan's donkey and take the widow's ox in pledge. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> They thrust the needy from the path and force all the poor of the land into hiding. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Like wild donkeys in the desert, the poor go about their labor of foraging food; the wasteland provides food for their children. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> They gather fodder in the fields and glean in the vineyards of the wicked. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Lacking clothes, they spend the night naked; they have nothing to cover themselves in the cold. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> They are drenched by mountain rains and hug the rocks for lack of shelter. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> The fatherless child is snatched from the breast; the infant of the poor is seized for a debt.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Lacking clothes, they go about naked; they carry the sheaves, but still go hungry. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> They crush olives among the terraces; they tread the winepresses, yet suffer thirst. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> The groans of the dying rise from the city, and the souls of the wounded cry out for help. But God charges no one with wrongdoing.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> "There are those who rebel against the light, who do not know its ways or stay in its paths. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> When daylight is gone, the murderer rises up and kills the poor and needy; in the night he steals forth like a thief. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> The eye of the adulterer watches for dusk; he thinks, 'No eye will see me,' and he keeps his face concealed. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> In the dark, men break into houses, but by day they shut themselves in; they want nothing to do with the light. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> For all of them, deep darkness is their morning; they make friends with the terrors of darkness.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> "Yet they are foam on the surface of the water; their portion of the land is cursed, so that no one goes to the vineyards. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> As heat and drought snatch away the melted snow, so the grave snatches away those who have sinned. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> The womb forgets them, the worm feasts on them; evil men are no longer remembered but are broken like a tree. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> They prey on the barren and childless woman, and to the widow show no kindness. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> But God drags away the mighty by his power; though they become established, they have no assurance of life. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> He may let them rest in a feeling of security, but his eyes are on their ways. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> For a little while they are exalted, and then they are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others; they are cut off like heads of grain.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> "If this is not so, who can prove me false and reduce my words to nothing?" </verse>
