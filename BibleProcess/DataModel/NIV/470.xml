    <verse value="1">Then Elihu said:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Hear my words, you wise men; listen to me, you men of learning. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> For the ear tests words as the tongue tastes food. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Let us discern for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> "Job says, 'I am innocent, but God denies me justice. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Although I am right, I am considered a liar; although I am guiltless, his arrow inflicts an incurable wound.' </verse>
    <verse value="7"> What man is like Job, who drinks scorn like water? </verse>
    <verse value="8"> He keeps company with evildoers; he associates with wicked men. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> For he says, 'It profits a man nothing when he tries to please God.'</verse>
    <verse value="10"> "So listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do evil, from the Almighty to do wrong.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> He repays a man for what he has done; he brings upon him what his conduct deserves. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> It is unthinkable that God would do wrong, that the Almighty would pervert justice. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> Who appointed him over the earth? Who put him in charge of the whole world? </verse>
    <verse value="14"> If it were his intention and he withdrew his spirit and breath, </verse>
    <verse value="15"> all mankind would perish together and man would return to the dust.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> "If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> Can he who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the just and mighty One?</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Is he not the One who says to kings, 'You are worthless,' and to nobles, 'You are wicked,' </verse>
    <verse value="19"> who shows no partiality to princes and does not favor the rich over the poor, for they are all the work of his hands? </verse>
    <verse value="20"> They die in an instant, in the middle of the night; the people are shaken and they pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> "His eyes are on the ways of men; he sees their every step. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> There is no dark place, no deep shadow, where evildoers can hide. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> God has no need to examine men further, that they should come before him for judgment. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> Without inquiry he shatters the mighty and sets up others in their place. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> Because he takes note of their deeds, he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> He punishes them for their wickedness where everyone can see them, </verse>
    <verse value="27"> because they turned from following him and had no regard for any of his ways. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> They caused the cry of the poor to come before him, so that he heard the cry of the needy.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> But if he remains silent, who can condemn him? If he hides his face, who can see him? Yet he is over man and nation alike, </verse>
    <verse value="30"> to keep a godless man from ruling, from laying snares for the people.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> "Suppose a man says to God, 'I am guilty but will offend no more. </verse>
    <verse value="32"> Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do so again.' </verse>
    <verse value="33"> Should God then reward you on your terms, when you refuse to repent? You must decide, not I; so tell me what you know.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> "Men of understanding declare, wise men who hear me say to me,</verse>
    <verse value="35"> 'Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.' </verse>
    <verse value="36"> Oh, that Job might be tested to the utmost for answering like a wicked man! </verse>
    <verse value="37"> To his sin he adds rebellion; scornfully he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God."</verse>
