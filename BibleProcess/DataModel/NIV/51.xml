    <verse value="1">These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family: </verse>
    <verse value="2"> Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy in all; Joseph was already in Egypt. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died, </verse>
    <verse value="7"> but the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> Then a new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power in Egypt. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> "Look," he said to his people, "the Israelites have become much too numerous for us. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country."</verse>
    <verse value="11"> So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites</verse>
    <verse value="13"> and worked them ruthlessly. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> They made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their hard labor the Egyptians used them ruthlessly. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah, </verse>
    <verse value="16"> "When you help the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live." </verse>
    <verse value="17"> The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?"</verse>
    <verse value="19"> The midwives answered Pharaoh, "Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive." </verse>
    <verse value="20"> So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: "Every boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live." </verse>
