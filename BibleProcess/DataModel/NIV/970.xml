    <verse value="1">As he was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Look, Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!"</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Do you see all these great buildings?" replied Jesus. "Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down." </verse>
    <verse value="3"> As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew asked him privately, </verse>
    <verse value="4"> "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled?"</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Jesus said to them: "Watch out that no one deceives you. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am he,' and will deceive many.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines. These are the beginning of birth pains.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> "You must be on your guard. You will be handed over to the local councils and flogged in the synagogues. On account of me you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> And the gospel must first be preached to all nations.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Whenever you are arrested and brought to trial, do not worry beforehand about what to say. Just say whatever is given you at the time, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> "Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> All men will hate you because of me, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> "When you see 'the abomination that causes desolation' standing where it does not belong--let the reader understand--then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Let no one on the roof of his house go down or enter the house to take anything out.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Let no one in the field go back to get his cloak.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! </verse>
    <verse value="18"> Pray that this will not take place in winter,</verse>
    <verse value="19"> because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning, when God created the world, until now--and never to be equaled again. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> If the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened them.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and miracles to deceive the elect--if that were possible. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> So be on your guard; I have told you everything ahead of time. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> "But in those days, following that distress, " 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light;</verse>
    <verse value="25"> the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.' </verse>
    <verse value="26"> "At that time men will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> "Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that it is near, right at the door.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. </verse>
    <verse value="31"> Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. </verse>
    <verse value="32"> "No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. </verse>
    <verse value="33"> Be on guard! Be alert! You do not know when that time will come.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> It's like a man going away: He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with his assigned task, and tells the one at the door to keep watch. </verse>
    <verse value="35"> "Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back--whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or at dawn.</verse>
    <verse value="36"> If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping.</verse>
    <verse value="37"> What I say to you, I say to everyone: 'Watch!' " </verse>
