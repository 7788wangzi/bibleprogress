    <verse value="1">"Have Aaron your brother brought to you from among the Israelites, along with his sons Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, so they may serve me as priests. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> Make sacred garments for your brother Aaron, to give him dignity and honor. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Tell all the skilled men to whom I have given wisdom in such matters that they are to make garments for Aaron, for his consecration, so he may serve me as priest. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> These are the garments they are to make: a breastpiece, an ephod, a robe, a woven tunic, a turban and a sash. They are to make these sacred garments for your brother Aaron and his sons, so they may serve me as priests. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Have them use gold, and blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and fine linen.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> "Make the ephod of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen--the work of a skilled craftsman. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> It is to have two shoulder pieces attached to two of its corners, so it can be fastened.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Its skillfully woven waistband is to be like it--of one piece with the ephod and made with gold, and with blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and with finely twisted linen. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> "Take two onyx stones and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel </verse>
    <verse value="10"> in the order of their birth--six names on one stone and the remaining six on the other.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Engrave the names of the sons of Israel on the two stones the way a gem cutter engraves a seal. Then mount the stones in gold filigree settings</verse>
    <verse value="12"> and fasten them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel. Aaron is to bear the names on his shoulders as a memorial before the LORD. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> Make gold filigree settings</verse>
    <verse value="14"> and two braided chains of pure gold, like a rope, and attach the chains to the settings.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> "Fashion a breastpiece for making decisions--the work of a skilled craftsman. Make it like the ephod: of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> It is to be square--a span long and a span wide--and folded double. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> Then mount four rows of precious stones on it. In the first row there shall be a ruby, a topaz and a beryl;</verse>
    <verse value="18"> in the second row a turquoise, a sapphire and an emerald; </verse>
    <verse value="19"> in the third row a jacinth, an agate and an amethyst;</verse>
    <verse value="20"> in the fourth row a chrysolite, an onyx and a jasper. Mount them in gold filigree settings. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> There are to be twelve stones, one for each of the names of the sons of Israel, each engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> "For the breastpiece make braided chains of pure gold, like a rope.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Make two gold rings for it and fasten them to two corners of the breastpiece.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Fasten the two gold chains to the rings at the corners of the breastpiece,</verse>
    <verse value="25"> and the other ends of the chains to the two settings, attaching them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Make two gold rings and attach them to the other two corners of the breastpiece on the inside edge next to the ephod.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Make two more gold rings and attach them to the bottom of the shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod, close to the seam just above the waistband of the ephod.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> The rings of the breastpiece are to be tied to the rings of the ephod with blue cord, connecting it to the waistband, so that the breastpiece will not swing out from the ephod.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> "Whenever Aaron enters the Holy Place, he will bear the names of the sons of Israel over his heart on the breastpiece of decision as a continuing memorial before the LORD. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> Also put the Urim and the Thummim in the breastpiece, so they may be over Aaron's heart whenever he enters the presence of the LORD. Thus Aaron will always bear the means of making decisions for the Israelites over his heart before the LORD. </verse>
    <verse value="31"> "Make the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth,</verse>
    <verse value="32"> with an opening for the head in its center. There shall be a woven edge like a collar around this opening, so that it will not tear. </verse>
    <verse value="33"> Make pomegranates of blue, purple and scarlet yarn around the hem of the robe, with gold bells between them. </verse>
    <verse value="34"> The gold bells and the pomegranates are to alternate around the hem of the robe.</verse>
    <verse value="35"> Aaron must wear it when he ministers. The sound of the bells will be heard when he enters the Holy Place before the LORD and when he comes out, so that he will not die.</verse>
    <verse value="36"> "Make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it as on a seal: HOLY TO THE LORD. </verse>
    <verse value="37"> Fasten a blue cord to it to attach it to the turban; it is to be on the front of the turban.</verse>
    <verse value="38"> It will be on Aaron's forehead, and he will bear the guilt involved in the sacred gifts the Israelites consecrate, whatever their gifts may be. It will be on Aaron's forehead continually so that they will be acceptable to the LORD. </verse>
    <verse value="39"> "Weave the tunic of fine linen and make the turban of fine linen. The sash is to be the work of an embroiderer.</verse>
    <verse value="40"> Make tunics, sashes and headbands for Aaron's sons, to give them dignity and honor. </verse>
    <verse value="41"> After you put these clothes on your brother Aaron and his sons, anoint and ordain them. Consecrate them so they may serve me as priests. </verse>
    <verse value="42"> "Make linen undergarments as a covering for the body, reaching from the waist to the thigh. </verse>
    <verse value="43"> Aaron and his sons must wear them whenever they enter the Tent of Meeting or approach the altar to minister in the Holy Place, so that they will not incur guilt and die. "This is to be a lasting ordinance for Aaron and his descendants. </verse>
