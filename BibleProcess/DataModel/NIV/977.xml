    <verse value="1">Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the desert,</verse>
    <verse value="2"> where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and at the end of them he was hungry. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> The devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread." </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man does not live on bread alone.' " </verse>
    <verse value="5"> The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> And he said to him, "I will give you all their authority and splendor, for it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> So if you worship me, it will all be yours."</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.' " </verse>
    <verse value="9"> The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. "If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down from here.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> For it is written: " 'He will command his angels concerning you to guard you carefully;</verse>
    <verse value="11"> they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.' " </verse>
    <verse value="12"> Jesus answered, "It says: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.' " </verse>
    <verse value="13"> When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an opportune time. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> He taught in their synagogues, and everyone praised him. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. And he stood up to read. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written:</verse>
    <verse value="18"> "The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to release the oppressed, </verse>
    <verse value="19"> to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor." </verse>
    <verse value="20"> Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him, </verse>
    <verse value="21"> and he began by saying to them, "Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing." </verse>
    <verse value="22"> All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. "Isn't this Joseph's son?" they asked. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> Jesus said to them, "Surely you will quote this proverb to me: 'Physician, heal yourself! Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.' "</verse>
    <verse value="24"> "I tell you the truth," he continued, "no prophet is accepted in his hometown. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah's time, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed--only Naaman the Syrian." </verse>
    <verse value="28"> All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him down the cliff. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way. </verse>
    <verse value="31"> Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath began to teach the people. </verse>
    <verse value="32"> They were amazed at his teaching, because his message had authority. </verse>
    <verse value="33"> In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an evil spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice, </verse>
    <verse value="34"> "Ha! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!"</verse>
    <verse value="35"> "Be quiet!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!" Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him. </verse>
    <verse value="36"> All the people were amazed and said to each other, "What is this teaching? With authority and power he gives orders to evil spirits and they come out!" </verse>
    <verse value="37"> And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area. </verse>
    <verse value="38"> Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her.</verse>
    <verse value="39"> So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began to wait on them. </verse>
    <verse value="40"> When the sun was setting, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them. </verse>
    <verse value="41"> Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, "You are the Son of God!" But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the Christ. </verse>
    <verse value="42"> At daybreak Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them.</verse>
    <verse value="43"> But he said, "I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent." </verse>
    <verse value="44"> And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea. </verse>
