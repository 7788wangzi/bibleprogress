    <verse value="1">Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> As men moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> They said to each other, "Come, let's make bricks and bake them thoroughly." They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Then they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth." </verse>
    <verse value="5"> But the LORD came down to see the city and the tower that the men were building. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> The LORD said, "If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other." </verse>
    <verse value="8"> So the LORD scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> That is why it was called Babel--because there the LORD confused the language of the whole world. From there the LORD scattered them over the face of the whole earth.</verse>
