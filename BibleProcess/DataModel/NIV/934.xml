    <verse value="1">Now when he saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him,</verse>
    <verse value="2"> and he began to teach them, saying:</verse>
    <verse value="3"> "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> "Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> "You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> "You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> "You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' </verse>
    <verse value="22"> But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca, ' is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> "Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,</verse>
    <verse value="24"> leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> "Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still with him on the way, or he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> I tell you the truth, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> "You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' </verse>
    <verse value="28"> But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. </verse>
    <verse value="29"> If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. </verse>
    <verse value="31"> "It has been said, 'Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.' </verse>
    <verse value="32"> But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery. </verse>
    <verse value="33"> "Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but keep the oaths you have made to the Lord.' </verse>
    <verse value="34"> But I tell you, Do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; </verse>
    <verse value="35"> or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. </verse>
    <verse value="36"> And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.</verse>
    <verse value="37"> Simply let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,' 'No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one. </verse>
    <verse value="38"> "You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.' </verse>
    <verse value="39"> But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. </verse>
    <verse value="40"> And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.</verse>
    <verse value="41"> If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles.</verse>
    <verse value="42"> Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. </verse>
    <verse value="43"> "You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' </verse>
    <verse value="44"> But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,</verse>
    <verse value="45"> that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. </verse>
    <verse value="46"> If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? </verse>
    <verse value="47"> And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that?</verse>
    <verse value="48"> Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect. </verse>
