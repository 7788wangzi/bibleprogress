    <verse value="1">The LORD spoke to Moses in the Tent of Meeting in the Desert of Sinai on the first day of the second month of the second year after the Israelites came out of Egypt. He said:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Take a census of the whole Israelite community by their clans and families, listing every man by name, one by one. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> You and Aaron are to number by their divisions all the men in Israel twenty years old or more who are able to serve in the army. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> One man from each tribe, each the head of his family, is to help you. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> These are the names of the men who are to assist you: from Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur;</verse>
    <verse value="6"> from Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai; </verse>
    <verse value="7"> from Judah, Nahshon son of Amminadab; </verse>
    <verse value="8"> from Issachar, Nethanel son of Zuar;</verse>
    <verse value="9"> from Zebulun, Eliab son of Helon;</verse>
    <verse value="10"> from the sons of Joseph: from Ephraim, Elishama son of Ammihud; from Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur; </verse>
    <verse value="11"> from Benjamin, Abidan son of Gideoni; </verse>
    <verse value="12"> from Dan, Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai; </verse>
    <verse value="13"> from Asher, Pagiel son of Ocran; </verse>
    <verse value="14"> from Gad, Eliasaph son of Deuel; </verse>
    <verse value="15"> from Naphtali, Ahira son of Enan."</verse>
    <verse value="16"> These were the men appointed from the community, the leaders of their ancestral tribes. They were the heads of the clans of Israel. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> Moses and Aaron took these men whose names had been given,</verse>
    <verse value="18"> and they called the whole community together on the first day of the second month. The people indicated their ancestry by their clans and families, and the men twenty years old or more were listed by name, one by one, </verse>
    <verse value="19"> as the LORD commanded Moses. And so he counted them in the Desert of Sinai:</verse>
    <verse value="20"> From the descendants of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, one by one, according to the records of their clans and families. </verse>

    <verse value="24"> From the descendants of Gad: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. </verse>

    <verse value="26"> From the descendants of Judah: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> The number from the tribe of Judah was 74,600.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> From the descendants of Issachar: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. </verse>

    <verse value="30"> From the descendants of Zebulun: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> The number from the tribe of Zebulun was 57,400.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> From the sons of Joseph: From the descendants of Ephraim: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. </verse>
    <verse value="33"> The number from the tribe of Ephraim was 40,500. </verse>
    <verse value="34"> From the descendants of Manasseh: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. </verse>
    <verse value="35"> The number from the tribe of Manasseh was 32,200.</verse>
    <verse value="36"> From the descendants of Benjamin: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. </verse>
    <verse value="37"> The number from the tribe of Benjamin was 35,400.</verse>
    <verse value="38"> From the descendants of Dan: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. </verse>
    <verse value="39"> The number from the tribe of Dan was 62,700.</verse>
    <verse value="40"> From the descendants of Asher: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families.</verse>
    <verse value="41"> The number from the tribe of Asher was 41,500.</verse>
    <verse value="42"> From the descendants of Naphtali: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. </verse>
    <verse value="43"> The number from the tribe of Naphtali was 53,400.</verse>
    <verse value="44"> These were the men counted by Moses and Aaron and the twelve leaders of Israel, each one representing his family. </verse>
    <verse value="45"> All the Israelites twenty years old or more who were able to serve in Israel's army were counted according to their families. </verse>
    <verse value="46"> The total number was 603,550. </verse>
    <verse value="47"> The families of the tribe of Levi, however, were not counted along with the others. </verse>
    <verse value="48"> The LORD had said to Moses:</verse>
    <verse value="49"> "You must not count the tribe of Levi or include them in the census of the other Israelites.</verse>
    <verse value="50"> Instead, appoint the Levites to be in charge of the tabernacle of the Testimony--over all its furnishings and everything belonging to it. They are to carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings; they are to take care of it and encamp around it. </verse>
    <verse value="51"> Whenever the tabernacle is to move, the Levites are to take it down, and whenever the tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites shall do it. Anyone else who goes near it shall be put to death. </verse>
    <verse value="52"> The Israelites are to set up their tents by divisions, each man in his own camp under his own standard. </verse>
    <verse value="53"> The Levites, however, are to set up their tents around the tabernacle of the Testimony so that wrath will not fall on the Israelite community. The Levites are to be responsible for the care of the tabernacle of the Testimony." </verse>
    <verse value="54"> The Israelites did all this just as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
