    <verse value="2"> it will be the same for priest as for people, for master as for servant, for mistress as for maid, for seller as for buyer, for borrower as for lender, for debtor as for creditor. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> The earth will be completely laid waste and totally plundered. The LORD has spoken this word.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> The earth dries up and withers, the world languishes and withers, the exalted of the earth languish. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> The earth is defiled by its people; they have disobeyed the laws, violated the statutes and broken the everlasting covenant. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Therefore a curse consumes the earth; its people must bear their guilt. Therefore earth's inhabitants are burned up, and very few are left. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> The new wine dries up and the vine withers; all the merrymakers groan. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> The gaiety of the tambourines is stilled, the noise of the revelers has stopped, the joyful harp is silent. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> No longer do they drink wine with a song; the beer is bitter to its drinkers.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> The ruined city lies desolate; the entrance to every house is barred. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> In the streets they cry out for wine; all joy turns to gloom, all gaiety is banished from the earth. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> The city is left in ruins, its gate is battered to pieces.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> So will it be on the earth and among the nations, as when an olive tree is beaten, or as when gleanings are left after the grape harvest.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> They raise their voices, they shout for joy; from the west they acclaim the LORD's majesty. </verse>

    <verse value="16"> From the ends of the earth we hear singing: "Glory to the Righteous One." But I said, "I waste away, I waste away! Woe to me! The treacherous betray! With treachery the treacherous betray!"</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Terror and pit and snare await you, O people of the earth. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> Whoever flees at the sound of terror will fall into a pit; whoever climbs out of the pit will be caught in a snare. The floodgates of the heavens are opened, the foundations of the earth shake.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> The earth is broken up, the earth is split asunder, the earth is thoroughly shaken. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> The earth reels like a drunkard, it sways like a hut in the wind; so heavy upon it is the guilt of its rebellion that it falls--never to rise again.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> In that day the LORD will punish the powers in the heavens above and the kings on the earth below. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> They will be herded together like prisoners bound in a dungeon; they will be shut up in prison and be punished after many days. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> The moon will be abashed, the sun ashamed; for the LORD Almighty will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before its elders, gloriously.</verse>
