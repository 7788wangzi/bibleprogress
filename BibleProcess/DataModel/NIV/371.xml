    <verse value="1">He made a bronze altar twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Below the rim, figures of bulls encircled it--ten to a cubit. The bulls were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> It was a handbreadth in thickness, and its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held three thousand baths. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> He then made ten basins for washing and placed five on the south side and five on the north. In them the things to be used for the burnt offerings were rinsed, but the Sea was to be used by the priests for washing.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> He made ten gold lampstands according to the specifications for them and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> He made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. He also made a hundred gold sprinkling bowls. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> He made the courtyard of the priests, and the large court and the doors for the court, and overlaid the doors with bronze. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> He placed the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> He also made the pots and shovels and sprinkling bowls. So Huram finished the work he had undertaken for King Solomon in the temple of God:</verse>
    <verse value="12"> the two pillars; the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; the two sets of network decorating the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars;</verse>
    <verse value="13"> the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network, decorating the bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars);</verse>
    <verse value="14"> the stands with their basins; </verse>
    <verse value="15"> the Sea and the twelve bulls under it;</verse>
    <verse value="16"> the pots, shovels, meat forks and all related articles. All the objects that Huram-Abi made for King Solomon for the temple of the LORD were of polished bronze.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Succoth and Zarethan. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> All these things that Solomon made amounted to so much that the weight of the bronze was not determined. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in God's temple: the golden altar; the tables on which was the bread of the Presence;</verse>
    <verse value="20"> the lampstands of pure gold with their lamps, to burn in front of the inner sanctuary as prescribed; </verse>
    <verse value="21"> the gold floral work and lamps and tongs (they were solid gold);</verse>
    <verse value="22"> the pure gold wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and censers; and the gold doors of the temple: the inner doors to the Most Holy Place and the doors of the main hall.</verse>
