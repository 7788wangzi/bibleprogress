    <verse value="2"> In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat-- for he grants sleep to those he loves.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Sons are a heritage from the LORD, children a reward from him. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are sons born in one's youth. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. They will not be put to shame when they contend with their enemies in the gate.</verse>
