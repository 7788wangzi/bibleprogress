    <verse value="1">My son, if you accept my words and store up my commands within you, </verse>
    <verse value="2"> turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding, </verse>
    <verse value="3"> and if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding, </verse>
    <verse value="4"> and if you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure, </verse>
    <verse value="5"> then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> For the LORD gives wisdom, and from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> He holds victory in store for the upright, he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless, </verse>
    <verse value="8"> for he guards the course of the just and protects the way of his faithful ones.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Then you will understand what is right and just and fair--every good path. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Discretion will protect you, and understanding will guard you.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men, from men whose words are perverse, </verse>
    <verse value="13"> who leave the straight paths to walk in dark ways, </verse>
    <verse value="14"> who delight in doing wrong and rejoice in the perverseness of evil, </verse>
    <verse value="15"> whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> It will save you also from the adulteress, from the wayward wife with her seductive words,</verse>
    <verse value="17"> who has left the partner of her youth and ignored the covenant she made before God. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> For her house leads down to death and her paths to the spirits of the dead. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> None who go to her return or attain the paths of life.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Thus you will walk in the ways of good men and keep to the paths of the righteous.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> For the upright will live in the land, and the blameless will remain in it; </verse>
    <verse value="22"> but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be torn from it.</verse>
