    <verse value="1">"Man born of woman is of few days and full of trouble. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> He springs up like a flower and withers away; like a fleeting shadow, he does not endure. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Do you fix your eye on such a one? Will you bring him before you for judgment? </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Who can bring what is pure from the impure? No one! </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Man's days are determined; you have decreed the number of his months and have set limits he cannot exceed. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> So look away from him and let him alone, till he has put in his time like a hired man.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> "At least there is hope for a tree: If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its new shoots will not fail.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Its roots may grow old in the ground and its stump die in the soil, </verse>
    <verse value="9"> yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth shoots like a plant. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> But man dies and is laid low; he breathes his last and is no more. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> As water disappears from the sea or a riverbed becomes parched and dry,</verse>
    <verse value="12"> so man lies down and does not rise; till the heavens are no more, men will not awake or be roused from their sleep.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> "If only you would hide me in the grave and conceal me till your anger has passed! If only you would set me a time and then remember me! </verse>
    <verse value="14"> If a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait for my renewal to come. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> You will call and I will answer you; you will long for the creature your hands have made. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> Surely then you will count my steps but not keep track of my sin. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> My offenses will be sealed up in a bag; you will cover over my sin.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> "But as a mountain erodes and crumbles and as a rock is moved from its place, </verse>
    <verse value="19"> as water wears away stones and torrents wash away the soil, so you destroy man's hope.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> You overpower him once for all, and he is gone; you change his countenance and send him away. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> If his sons are honored, he does not know it; if they are brought low, he does not see it.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> He feels but the pain of his own body and mourns only for himself."</verse>
