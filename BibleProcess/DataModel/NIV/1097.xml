    <verse value="1">Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore him gently. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Each one should test his own actions. Then he can take pride in himself, without comparing himself to somebody else, </verse>
    <verse value="5"> for each one should carry his own load. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Anyone who receives instruction in the word must share all good things with his instructor. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction; the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand! </verse>
    <verse value="12"> Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> Not even those who are circumcised obey the law, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your flesh. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is a new creation. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule, even to the Israel of God.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Finally, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen. </verse>
