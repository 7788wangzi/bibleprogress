    <verse value="1">The sayings of Agur son of Jakeh--an oracle: This man declared to Ithiel, to Ithiel and to Ucal:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "I am the most ignorant of men; I do not have a man's understanding.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> I have not learned wisdom, nor have I knowledge of the Holy One. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Who has gone up to heaven and come down? Who has gathered up the wind in the hollow of his hands? Who has wrapped up the waters in his cloak? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and the name of his son? Tell me if you know!</verse>
    <verse value="5"> "Every word of God is flawless; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Do not add to his words, or he will rebuke you and prove you a liar.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> "Two things I ask of you, O LORD; do not refuse me before I die:</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Keep falsehood and lies far from me; give me neither poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily bread. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Otherwise, I may have too much and disown you and say, 'Who is the LORD?' Or I may become poor and steal, and so dishonor the name of my God.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> "Do not slander a servant to his master, or he will curse you, and you will pay for it.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> "There are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers; </verse>
    <verse value="12"> those who are pure in their own eyes and yet are not cleansed of their filth; </verse>
    <verse value="13"> those whose eyes are ever so haughty, whose glances are so disdainful; </verse>
    <verse value="14"> those whose teeth are swords and whose jaws are set with knives to devour the poor from the earth, the needy from among mankind.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> "The leech has two daughters. 'Give! Give!' they cry. "There are three things that are never satisfied, four that never say, 'Enough!':</verse>
    <verse value="16"> the grave, the barren womb, land, which is never satisfied with water, and fire, which never says, 'Enough!'</verse>
    <verse value="17"> "The eye that mocks a father, that scorns obedience to a mother, will be pecked out by the ravens of the valley, will be eaten by the vultures.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> "There are three things that are too amazing for me, four that I do not understand:</verse>
    <verse value="19"> the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a maiden.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> "This is the way of an adulteress: She eats and wipes her mouth and says, 'I've done nothing wrong.'</verse>
    <verse value="21"> "Under three things the earth trembles, under four it cannot bear up:</verse>
    <verse value="22"> a servant who becomes king, a fool who is full of food, </verse>
    <verse value="23"> an unloved woman who is married, and a maidservant who displaces her mistress.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> "Four things on earth are small, yet they are extremely wise:</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Ants are creatures of little strength, yet they store up their food in the summer; </verse>
    <verse value="26"> coneys are creatures of little power, yet they make their home in the crags; </verse>
    <verse value="27"> locusts have no king, yet they advance together in ranks; </verse>
    <verse value="28"> a lizard can be caught with the hand, yet it is found in kings' palaces.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> "There are three things that are stately in their stride, four that move with stately bearing:</verse>
    <verse value="30"> a lion, mighty among beasts, who retreats before nothing;</verse>
    <verse value="31"> a strutting rooster, a he-goat, and a king with his army around him.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> "If you have played the fool and exalted yourself, or if you have planned evil, clap your hand over your mouth! </verse>
    <verse value="33"> For as churning the milk produces butter, and as twisting the nose produces blood, so stirring up anger produces strife."</verse>
