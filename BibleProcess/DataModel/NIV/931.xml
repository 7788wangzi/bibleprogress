    <verse value="1">After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem </verse>
    <verse value="2"> and asked, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him." </verse>
    <verse value="3"> When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> When he had called together all the people's chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Christ was to be born. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> "In Bethlehem in Judea," they replied, "for this is what the prophet has written: </verse>
    <verse value="6"> " 'But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel.' " </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and make a careful search for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him."</verse>
    <verse value="9"> After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and of incense and of myrrh. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. "Get up," he said, "take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him." </verse>
    <verse value="14"> So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt,</verse>
    <verse value="15"> where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son." </verse>
    <verse value="16"> When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: </verse>
    <verse value="18"> "A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more." </verse>
    <verse value="19"> After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt </verse>
    <verse value="20"> and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child's life are dead."</verse>
    <verse value="21"> So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee, </verse>
    <verse value="23"> and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets: "He will be called a Nazarene." </verse>
