    <verse value="4"> I will allow no sleep to my eyes, no slumber to my eyelids,</verse>
    <verse value="5"> till I find a place for the LORD, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob."</verse>
    <verse value="6"> We heard it in Ephrathah, we came upon it in the fields of Jaar: </verse>
    <verse value="7"> "Let us go to his dwelling place; let us worship at his footstool-- </verse>
    <verse value="8"> arise, O LORD, and come to your resting place, you and the ark of your might. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> May your priests be clothed with righteousness; may your saints sing for joy."</verse>

    <verse value="12"> if your sons keep my covenant and the statutes I teach them, then their sons will sit on your throne for ever and ever."</verse>
    <verse value="13"> For the LORD has chosen Zion, he has desired it for his dwelling: </verse>
    <verse value="14"> "This is my resting place for ever and ever; here I will sit enthroned, for I have desired it-- </verse>
    <verse value="15"> I will bless her with abundant provisions; her poor will I satisfy with food. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints will ever sing for joy.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> "Here I will make a horn grow for David and set up a lamp for my anointed one.</verse>
