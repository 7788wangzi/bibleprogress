    <verse value="1">Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God's house. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Moses was faithful as a servant in all God's house, testifying to what would be said in the future. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> But Christ is faithful as a son over God's house. And we are his house, if we hold on to our courage and the hope of which we boast.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> So, as the Holy Spirit says: "Today, if you hear his voice, </verse>
    <verse value="8"> do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion, during the time of testing in the desert, </verse>
    <verse value="9"> where your fathers tested and tried me and for forty years saw what I did. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> That is why I was angry with that generation, and I said, 'Their hearts are always going astray, and they have not known my ways.'</verse>
    <verse value="11"> So I declared on oath in my anger, 'They shall never enter my rest.' " </verse>
    <verse value="12"> See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly till the end the confidence we had at first. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> As has just been said: "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion." </verse>
    <verse value="16"> Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt? </verse>
    <verse value="17"> And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the desert? </verse>
    <verse value="18"> And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed?</verse>
    <verse value="19"> So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief. </verse>
