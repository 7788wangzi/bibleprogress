    <verse value="1">Then Elihu said:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Do you think this is just? You say, 'I will be cleared by God. ' </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Yet you ask him, 'What profit is it to me, and what do I gain by not sinning?'</verse>
    <verse value="4"> "I would like to reply to you and to your friends with you.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Look up at the heavens and see; gaze at the clouds so high above you. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> If you sin, how does that affect him? If your sins are many, what does that do to him? </verse>
    <verse value="7"> If you are righteous, what do you give to him, or what does he receive from your hand? </verse>
    <verse value="8"> Your wickedness affects only a man like yourself, and your righteousness only the sons of men.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> "Men cry out under a load of oppression; they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> But no one says, 'Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night, </verse>
    <verse value="11"> who teaches more to us than to the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the air?' </verse>
    <verse value="12"> He does not answer when men cry out because of the arrogance of the wicked. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> Indeed, God does not listen to their empty plea; the Almighty pays no attention to it. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> How much less, then, will he listen when you say that you do not see him, that your case is before him and you must wait for him, </verse>
    <verse value="15"> and further, that his anger never punishes and he does not take the least notice of wickedness. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> So Job opens his mouth with empty talk; without knowledge he multiplies words."</verse>
