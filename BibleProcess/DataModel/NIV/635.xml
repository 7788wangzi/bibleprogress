    <verse value="1">My son, keep my words and store up my commands within you. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> Keep my commands and you will live; guard my teachings as the apple of your eye.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," and call understanding your kinsman;</verse>
    <verse value="5"> they will keep you from the adulteress, from the wayward wife with her seductive words.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> At the window of my house I looked out through the lattice.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> I saw among the simple, I noticed among the young men, a youth who lacked judgment. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> He was going down the street near her corner, walking along in the direction of her house</verse>
    <verse value="9"> at twilight, as the day was fading, as the dark of night set in.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Then out came a woman to meet him, dressed like a prostitute and with crafty intent.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> (She is loud and defiant, her feet never stay at home; </verse>
    <verse value="12"> now in the street, now in the squares, at every corner she lurks.) </verse>
    <verse value="13"> She took hold of him and kissed him and with a brazen face she said:</verse>
    <verse value="14"> "I have fellowship offerings at home; today I fulfilled my vows. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> So I came out to meet you; I looked for you and have found you!</verse>
    <verse value="16"> I have covered my bed with colored linens from Egypt.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> Come, let's drink deep of love till morning; let's enjoy ourselves with love! </verse>
    <verse value="19"> My husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> He took his purse filled with money and will not be home till full moon."</verse>
    <verse value="21"> With persuasive words she led him astray; she seduced him with her smooth talk. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> All at once he followed her like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer stepping into a noose </verse>
    <verse value="23"> till an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare, little knowing it will cost him his life.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Now then, my sons, listen to me; pay attention to what I say. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> Do not let your heart turn to her ways or stray into her paths.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Many are the victims she has brought down; her slain are a mighty throng.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Her house is a highway to the grave, leading down to the chambers of death.</verse>
