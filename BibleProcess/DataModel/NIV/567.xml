    <verse value="1">A [maskil] of Ethan the Ezrahite. I will sing of the LORD's great love forever; with my mouth I will make your faithfulness known through all generations. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> I will declare that your love stands firm forever, that you established your faithfulness in heaven itself.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> You said, "I have made a covenant with my chosen one, I have sworn to David my servant,</verse>
    <verse value="4"> 'I will establish your line forever and make your throne firm through all generations.' " [Selah]</verse>
    <verse value="5"> The heavens praise your wonders, O LORD, your faithfulness too, in the assembly of the holy ones.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> For who in the skies above can compare with the LORD? Who is like the LORD among the heavenly beings? </verse>
    <verse value="7"> In the council of the holy ones God is greatly feared; he is more awesome than all who surround him.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> O LORD God Almighty, who is like you? You are mighty, O LORD, and your faithfulness surrounds you.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> You rule over the surging sea; when its waves mount up, you still them. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> You crushed Rahab like one of the slain; with your strong arm you scattered your enemies. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> The heavens are yours, and yours also the earth; you founded the world and all that is in it. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> You created the north and the south; Tabor and Hermon sing for joy at your name. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> Your arm is endued with power; your hand is strong, your right hand exalted.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; love and faithfulness go before you.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Blessed are those who have learned to acclaim you, who walk in the light of your presence, O LORD.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> They rejoice in your name all day long; they exult in your righteousness. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> For you are their glory and strength, and by your favor you exalt our horn. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> Indeed, our shield belongs to the LORD, our king to the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Once you spoke in a vision, to your faithful people you said: "I have bestowed strength on a warrior; I have exalted a young man from among the people.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> I have found David my servant; with my sacred oil I have anointed him. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> My hand will sustain him; surely my arm will strengthen him. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> No enemy will subject him to tribute; no wicked man will oppress him.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> I will crush his foes before him and strike down his adversaries. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> My faithful love will be with him, and through my name his horn will be exalted. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> I will set his hand over the sea, his right hand over the rivers. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> He will call out to me, 'You are my Father, my God, the Rock my Savior.' </verse>
    <verse value="27"> I will also appoint him my firstborn, the most exalted of the kings of the earth. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> I will maintain my love to him forever, and my covenant with him will never fail. </verse>
    <verse value="29"> I will establish his line forever, his throne as long as the heavens endure.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> "If his sons forsake my law and do not follow my statutes,</verse>
    <verse value="31"> if they violate my decrees and fail to keep my commands,</verse>
    <verse value="32"> I will punish their sin with the rod, their iniquity with flogging; </verse>
    <verse value="33"> but I will not take my love from him, nor will I ever betray my faithfulness.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> I will not violate my covenant or alter what my lips have uttered. </verse>
    <verse value="35"> Once for all, I have sworn by my holiness-- and I will not lie to David--</verse>
    <verse value="36"> that his line will continue forever and his throne endure before me like the sun; </verse>
    <verse value="37"> it will be established forever like the moon, the faithful witness in the sky." [Selah]</verse>
    <verse value="38"> But you have rejected, you have spurned, you have been very angry with your anointed one. </verse>
    <verse value="39"> You have renounced the covenant with your servant and have defiled his crown in the dust. </verse>
    <verse value="40"> You have broken through all his walls and reduced his strongholds to ruins. </verse>
    <verse value="41"> All who pass by have plundered him; he has become the scorn of his neighbors. </verse>
    <verse value="42"> You have exalted the right hand of his foes; you have made all his enemies rejoice. </verse>
    <verse value="43"> You have turned back the edge of his sword and have not supported him in battle.</verse>
    <verse value="44"> You have put an end to his splendor and cast his throne to the ground.</verse>
    <verse value="45"> You have cut short the days of his youth; you have covered him with a mantle of shame. [Selah]</verse>
    <verse value="46"> How long, O LORD? Will you hide yourself forever? How long will your wrath burn like fire? </verse>
    <verse value="47"> Remember how fleeting is my life. For what futility you have created all men! </verse>
    <verse value="48"> What man can live and not see death, or save himself from the power of the grave? [Selah]</verse>
    <verse value="49"> O Lord, where is your former great love, which in your faithfulness you swore to David?</verse>
    <verse value="50"> Remember, Lord, how your servant has been mocked, how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the nations, </verse>
    <verse value="51"> the taunts with which your enemies have mocked, O LORD, with which they have mocked every step of your anointed one.</verse>
    <verse value="52"> Praise be to the LORD forever! Amen and Amen.</verse>
