    <verse value="1">A prayer of an afflicted man. When he is faint and pours out his lament before the LORD. Hear my prayer, O LORD; let my cry for help come to you. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> Do not hide your face from me when I am in distress. Turn your ear to me; when I call, answer me quickly.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For my days vanish like smoke; my bones burn like glowing embers. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> My heart is blighted and withered like grass; I forget to eat my food.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Because of my loud groaning I am reduced to skin and bones. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> I am like a desert owl, like an owl among the ruins. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> I lie awake; I have become like a bird alone on a roof. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> All day long my enemies taunt me; those who rail against me use my name as a curse.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> For I eat ashes as my food and mingle my drink with tears </verse>
    <verse value="10"> because of your great wrath, for you have taken me up and thrown me aside. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> My days are like the evening shadow; I wither away like grass.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> But you, O LORD, sit enthroned forever; your renown endures through all generations. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to show favor to her; the appointed time has come.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> For her stones are dear to your servants; her very dust moves them to pity.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> The nations will fear the name of the LORD, all the kings of the earth will revere your glory. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> For the LORD will rebuild Zion and appear in his glory. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> He will respond to the prayer of the destitute; he will not despise their plea.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Let this be written for a future generation, that a people not yet created may praise the LORD: </verse>
    <verse value="19"> "The LORD looked down from his sanctuary on high, from heaven he viewed the earth, </verse>
    <verse value="20"> to hear the groans of the prisoners and release those condemned to death." </verse>
    <verse value="21"> So the name of the LORD will be declared in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem </verse>
    <verse value="22"> when the peoples and the kingdoms assemble to worship the LORD.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> In the course of my life he broke my strength; he cut short my days. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> So I said: "Do not take me away, O my God, in the midst of my days; your years go on through all generations.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> In the beginning you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing you will change them and they will be discarded. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> But you remain the same, and your years will never end. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> The children of your servants will live in your presence; their descendants will be established before you." </verse>
