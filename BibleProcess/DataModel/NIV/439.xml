    <verse value="1">After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> He said:</verse>
    <verse value="3"> "May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said, 'A boy is born!' </verse>
    <verse value="4"> That day--may it turn to darkness; may God above not care about it; may no light shine upon it.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> May darkness and deep shadow claim it once more; may a cloud settle over it; may blackness overwhelm its light. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> That night--may thick darkness seize it; may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> May that night be barren; may no shout of joy be heard in it. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> May those who curse days curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> May its morning stars become dark; may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn, </verse>
    <verse value="10"> for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> "Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb? </verse>
    <verse value="12"> Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed? </verse>
    <verse value="13"> For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest</verse>
    <verse value="14"> with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins, </verse>
    <verse value="15"> with rulers who had gold, who filled their houses with silver. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> Or why was I not hidden in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day? </verse>
    <verse value="17"> There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave driver's shout. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> The small and the great are there, and the slave is freed from his master.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> "Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,</verse>
    <verse value="21"> to those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure, </verse>
    <verse value="22"> who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave? </verse>
    <verse value="23"> Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in? </verse>
    <verse value="24"> For sighing comes to me instead of food; my groans pour out like water. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened to me. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> I have no peace, no quietness; I have no rest, but only turmoil."</verse>
