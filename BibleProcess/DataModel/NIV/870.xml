    <verse value="1">"Put the trumpet to your lips! An eagle is over the house of the LORD because the people have broken my covenant and rebelled against my law. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> Israel cries out to me, 'O our God, we acknowledge you!'</verse>
    <verse value="3"> But Israel has rejected what is good; an enemy will pursue him. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> They set up kings without my consent; they choose princes without my approval. With their silver and gold they make idols for themselves to their own destruction. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Throw out your calf-idol, O Samaria! My anger burns against them. How long will they be incapable of purity? </verse>
    <verse value="6"> They are from Israel! This calf--a craftsman has made it; it is not God. It will be broken in pieces, that calf of Samaria.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> "They sow the wind and reap the whirlwind. The stalk has no head; it will produce no flour. Were it to yield grain, foreigners would swallow it up. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> Israel is swallowed up; now she is among the nations like a worthless thing. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> For they have gone up to Assyria like a wild donkey wandering alone. Ephraim has sold herself to lovers. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> Although they have sold themselves among the nations, I will now gather them together. They will begin to waste away under the oppression of the mighty king.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> "Though Ephraim built many altars for sin offerings, these have become altars for sinning. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> I wrote for them the many things of my law, but they regarded them as something alien. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> They offer sacrifices given to me and they eat the meat, but the LORD is not pleased with them. Now he will remember their wickedness and punish their sins: They will return to Egypt.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces; Judah has fortified many towns. But I will send fire upon their cities that will consume their fortresses."</verse>
