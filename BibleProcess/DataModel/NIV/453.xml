    <verse value="1">1 My spirit is broken, my days are cut short, the grave awaits me.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Surely mockers surround me; my eyes must dwell on their hostility.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> "Give me, O God, the pledge you demand. Who else will put up security for me? </verse>
    <verse value="4"> You have closed their minds to understanding; therefore you will not let them triumph. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> If a man denounces his friends for reward, the eyes of his children will fail.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> "God has made me a byword to everyone, a man in whose face people spit. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> My eyes have grown dim with grief; my whole frame is but a shadow. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> Upright men are appalled at this; the innocent are aroused against the ungodly.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Nevertheless, the righteous will hold to their ways, and those with clean hands will grow stronger.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> "But come on, all of you, try again! I will not find a wise man among you. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> My days have passed, my plans are shattered, and so are the desires of my heart. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> These men turn night into day; in the face of darkness they say, 'Light is near.' </verse>
    <verse value="13"> If the only home I hope for is the grave, if I spread out my bed in darkness,</verse>
    <verse value="14"> if I say to corruption, 'You are my father,' and to the worm, 'My mother' or 'My sister,' </verse>
    <verse value="15"> where then is my hope? Who can see any hope for me? </verse>
    <verse value="16"> Will it go down to the gates of death? Will we descend together into the dust?"</verse>
