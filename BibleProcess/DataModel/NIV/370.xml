    <verse value="1">Then Solomon began to build the temple of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD had appeared to his father David. It was on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, the place provided by David. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> He began building on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> The foundation Solomon laid for building the temple of God was sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide (using the cubit of the old standard). </verse>
    <verse value="4"> The portico at the front of the temple was twenty cubits long across the width of the building and twenty cubits high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> He paneled the main hall with pine and covered it with fine gold and decorated it with palm tree and chain designs.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> He adorned the temple with precious stones. And the gold he used was gold of Parvaim.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> He overlaid the ceiling beams, doorframes, walls and doors of the temple with gold, and he carved cherubim on the walls. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> He built the Most Holy Place, its length corresponding to the width of the temple--twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide. He overlaid the inside with six hundred talents of fine gold. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> The gold nails weighed fifty shekels. He also overlaid the upper parts with gold. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> In the Most Holy Place he made a pair of sculptured cherubim and overlaid them with gold. </verse>

    <verse value="13"> The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits. They stood on their feet, facing the main hall. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> He made the curtain of blue, purple and crimson yarn and fine linen, with cherubim worked into it.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> In the front of the temple he made two pillars, which [together] were thirty-five cubits long, each with a capital on top measuring five cubits. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> He made interwoven chains and put them on top of the pillars. He also made a hundred pomegranates and attached them to the chains. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> He erected the pillars in the front of the temple, one to the south and one to the north. The one to the south he named Jakin and the one to the north Boaz. </verse>
