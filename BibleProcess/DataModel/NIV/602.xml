    <verse value="1">A song of ascents. Of David. If the LORD had not been on our side-- let Israel say-- </verse>
    <verse value="2"> if the LORD had not been on our side when men attacked us,</verse>
    <verse value="3"> when their anger flared against us, they would have swallowed us alive;</verse>
    <verse value="4"> the flood would have engulfed us, the torrent would have swept over us, </verse>
    <verse value="5"> the raging waters would have swept us away.</verse>
