    <verse value="1">My son, pay attention to my wisdom, listen well to my words of insight,</verse>
    <verse value="2"> that you may maintain discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For the lips of an adulteress drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil; </verse>
    <verse value="4"> but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> She gives no thought to the way of life; her paths are crooked, but she knows it not.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Now then, my sons, listen to me; do not turn aside from what I say. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> Keep to a path far from her, do not go near the door of her house,</verse>
    <verse value="9"> lest you give your best strength to others and your years to one who is cruel,</verse>
    <verse value="10"> lest strangers feast on your wealth and your toil enrich another man's house. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> At the end of your life you will groan, when your flesh and body are spent.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> You will say, "How I hated discipline! How my heart spurned correction! </verse>
    <verse value="13"> I would not obey my teachers or listen to my instructors.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> I have come to the brink of utter ruin in the midst of the whole assembly."</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Drink water from your own cistern, running water from your own well.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Should your springs overflow in the streets, your streams of water in the public squares?</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> A loving doe, a graceful deer-- may her breasts satisfy you always, may you ever be captivated by her love.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Why be captivated, my son, by an adulteress? Why embrace the bosom of another man's wife?</verse>
    <verse value="21"> For a man's ways are in full view of the LORD, and he examines all his paths. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> The evil deeds of a wicked man ensnare him; the cords of his sin hold him fast. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> He will die for lack of discipline, led astray by his own great folly.</verse>
