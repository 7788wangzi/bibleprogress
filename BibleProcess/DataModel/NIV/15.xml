    <verse value="1">After this, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: "Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your very great reward. " </verse>
    <verse value="2"> But Abram said, "O Sovereign LORD, what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?" </verse>
    <verse value="3"> And Abram said, "You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be my heir." </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Then the word of the LORD came to him: "This man will not be your heir, but a son coming from your own body will be your heir." </verse>
    <verse value="5"> He took him outside and said, "Look up at the heavens and count the stars--if indeed you can count them." Then he said to him, "So shall your offspring be." </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> He also said to him, "I am the LORD, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it." </verse>
    <verse value="8"> But Abram said, "O Sovereign LORD, how can I know that I will gain possession of it?" </verse>
    <verse value="9"> So the LORD said to him, "Bring me a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon." </verse>
    <verse value="10"> Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> Then the LORD said to him, "Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> You, however, will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a good old age. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure." </verse>
    <verse value="17"> When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram and said, "To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates-- </verse>
    <verse value="19"> the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, </verse>
    <verse value="20"> Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, </verse>
    <verse value="21"> Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites." </verse>
