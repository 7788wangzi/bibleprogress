    <verse value="1">"Can you pull in the leviathan with a fishhook or tie down his tongue with a rope? </verse>
    <verse value="2"> Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook? </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Will he keep begging you for mercy? Will he speak to you with gentle words? </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Will he make an agreement with you for you to take him as your slave for life? </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Can you make a pet of him like a bird or put him on a leash for your girls?</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Will traders barter for him? Will they divide him up among the merchants?</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears? </verse>
    <verse value="8"> If you lay a hand on him, you will remember the struggle and never do it again! </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Any hope of subduing him is false; the mere sight of him is overpowering. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> No one is fierce enough to rouse him. Who then is able to stand against me? </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Who has a claim against me that I must pay? Everything under heaven belongs to me.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> "I will not fail to speak of his limbs, his strength and his graceful form. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> Who can strip off his outer coat? Who would approach him with a bridle? </verse>
    <verse value="14"> Who dares open the doors of his mouth, ringed about with his fearsome teeth? </verse>
    <verse value="15"> His back has rows of shields tightly sealed together; </verse>
    <verse value="16"> each is so close to the next that no air can pass between.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> They are joined fast to one another; they cling together and cannot be parted.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> His snorting throws out flashes of light; his eyes are like the rays of dawn. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> Firebrands stream from his mouth; sparks of fire shoot out. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> Smoke pours from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over a fire of reeds. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from his mouth. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> Strength resides in his neck; dismay goes before him. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> His chest is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> When he rises up, the mighty are terrified; they retreat before his thrashing. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> The sword that reaches him has no effect, nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> Iron he treats like straw and bronze like rotten wood. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> Arrows do not make him flee; slingstones are like chaff to him. </verse>
    <verse value="29"> A club seems to him but a piece of straw; he laughs at the rattling of the lance. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> His undersides are jagged potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge. </verse>
    <verse value="31"> He makes the depths churn like a boiling caldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment. </verse>
    <verse value="32"> Behind him he leaves a glistening wake; one would think the deep had white hair.</verse>
    <verse value="33"> Nothing on earth is his equal-- a creature without fear. </verse>
    <verse value="34"> He looks down on all that are haughty; he is king over all that are proud." </verse>
