    <verse value="1">Miriam and Aaron began to talk against Moses because of his Cushite wife, for he had married a Cushite. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Has the LORD spoken only through Moses?" they asked. "Hasn't he also spoken through us?" And the LORD heard this. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> (Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth.) </verse>
    <verse value="4"> At once the LORD said to Moses, Aaron and Miriam, "Come out to the Tent of Meeting, all three of you." So the three of them came out.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Then the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud; he stood at the entrance to the Tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When both of them stepped forward, </verse>
    <verse value="6"> he said, "Listen to my words: "When a prophet of the LORD is among you, I reveal myself to him in visions, I speak to him in dreams. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> But this is not true of my servant Moses; he is faithful in all my house. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> With him I speak face to face, clearly and not in riddles; he sees the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?" </verse>
    <verse value="9"> The anger of the LORD burned against them, and he left them. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> When the cloud lifted from above the Tent, there stood Miriam--leprous, like snow. Aaron turned toward her and saw that she had leprosy; </verse>
    <verse value="11"> and he said to Moses, "Please, my lord, do not hold against us the sin we have so foolishly committed. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> Do not let her be like a stillborn infant coming from its mother's womb with its flesh half eaten away."</verse>
    <verse value="13"> So Moses cried out to the LORD, "O God, please heal her!" </verse>
    <verse value="14"> The LORD replied to Moses, "If her father had spit in her face, would she not have been in disgrace for seven days? Confine her outside the camp for seven days; after that she can be brought back." </verse>
    <verse value="15"> So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on till she was brought back. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> After that, the people left Hazeroth and encamped in the Desert of Paran. </verse>
