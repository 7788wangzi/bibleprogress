    <verse value="1">I have seen another evil under the sun, and it weighs heavily on men:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> God gives a man wealth, possessions and honor, so that he lacks nothing his heart desires, but God does not enable him to enjoy them, and a stranger enjoys them instead. This is meaningless, a grievous evil. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> A man may have a hundred children and live many years; yet no matter how long he lives, if he cannot enjoy his prosperity and does not receive proper burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> It comes without meaning, it departs in darkness, and in darkness its name is shrouded.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Though it never saw the sun or knew anything, it has more rest than does that man--</verse>
    <verse value="6"> even if he lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do not all go to the same place? </verse>
    <verse value="7"> All man's efforts are for his mouth, yet his appetite is never satisfied. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> What advantage has a wise man over a fool? What does a poor man gain by knowing how to conduct himself before others? </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Better what the eye sees than the roving of the appetite. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Whatever exists has already been named, and what man is has been known; no man can contend with one who is stronger than he. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> The more the words, the less the meaning, and how does that profit anyone?</verse>
    <verse value="12"> For who knows what is good for a man in life, during the few and meaningless days he passes through like a shadow? Who can tell him what will happen under the sun after he is gone? </verse>
