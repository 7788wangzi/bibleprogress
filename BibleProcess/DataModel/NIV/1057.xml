    <verse value="1">I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don't you know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah--how he appealed to God against Israel: </verse>
    <verse value="3"> "Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me"?</verse>
    <verse value="4"> And what was God's answer to him? "I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal." </verse>
    <verse value="5"> So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> What then? What Israel sought so earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened, </verse>
    <verse value="8"> as it is written: "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes so that they could not see and ears so that they could not hear, to this very day." </verse>
    <verse value="9"> And David says: "May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever." </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring! </verse>
    <verse value="13"> I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I make much of my ministry </verse>
    <verse value="14"> in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? </verse>
    <verse value="16"> If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root, </verse>
    <verse value="18"> do not boast over those branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in."</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree! </verse>
    <verse value="25"> I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: "The deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> And this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins." </verse>
    <verse value="28"> As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies on your account; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs, </verse>
    <verse value="29"> for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience, </verse>
    <verse value="31"> so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you. </verse>
    <verse value="32"> For God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all. </verse>
    <verse value="33"> Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! </verse>
    <verse value="34"> "Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?" </verse>
    <verse value="35"> "Who has ever given to God, that God should repay him?" </verse>
    <verse value="36"> For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen. </verse>
