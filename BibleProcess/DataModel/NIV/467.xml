    <verse value="1">"I made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at a girl.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> For what is man's lot from God above, his heritage from the Almighty on high? </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Is it not ruin for the wicked, disaster for those who do wrong? </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Does he not see my ways and count my every step?</verse>
    <verse value="5"> "If I have walked in falsehood or my foot has hurried after deceit-- </verse>
    <verse value="6"> let God weigh me in honest scales and he will know that I am blameless-- </verse>
    <verse value="7"> if my steps have turned from the path, if my heart has been led by my eyes, or if my hands have been defiled, </verse>
    <verse value="8"> then may others eat what I have sown, and may my crops be uprooted.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> "If my heart has been enticed by a woman, or if I have lurked at my neighbor's door, </verse>
    <verse value="10"> then may my wife grind another man's grain, and may other men sleep with her. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> For that would have been shameful, a sin to be judged. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> It is a fire that burns to Destruction; it would have uprooted my harvest.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> "If I have denied justice to my menservants and maidservants when they had a grievance against me, </verse>
    <verse value="14"> what will I do when God confronts me? What will I answer when called to account? </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Did not he who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same one form us both within our mothers?</verse>
    <verse value="16"> "If I have denied the desires of the poor or let the eyes of the widow grow weary, </verse>
    <verse value="17"> if I have kept my bread to myself, not sharing it with the fatherless-- </verse>
    <verse value="18"> but from my youth I reared him as would a father, and from my birth I guided the widow-- </verse>
    <verse value="19"> if I have seen anyone perishing for lack of clothing, or a needy man without a garment,</verse>
    <verse value="20"> and his heart did not bless me for warming him with the fleece from my sheep, </verse>
    <verse value="21"> if I have raised my hand against the fatherless, knowing that I had influence in court,</verse>
    <verse value="22"> then let my arm fall from the shoulder, let it be broken off at the joint. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> For I dreaded destruction from God, and for fear of his splendor I could not do such things.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> "If I have put my trust in gold or said to pure gold, 'You are my security,' </verse>
    <verse value="25"> if I have rejoiced over my great wealth, the fortune my hands had gained, </verse>
    <verse value="26"> if I have regarded the sun in its radiance or the moon moving in splendor, </verse>
    <verse value="27"> so that my heart was secretly enticed and my hand offered them a kiss of homage, </verse>
    <verse value="28"> then these also would be sins to be judged, for I would have been unfaithful to God on high.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> "If I have rejoiced at my enemy's misfortune or gloated over the trouble that came to him--</verse>
    <verse value="30"> I have not allowed my mouth to sin by invoking a curse against his life-- </verse>
    <verse value="31"> if the men of my household have never said, 'Who has not had his fill of Job's meat?'-- </verse>
    <verse value="32"> but no stranger had to spend the night in the street, for my door was always open to the traveler--</verse>
    <verse value="33"> if I have concealed my sin as men do, by hiding my guilt in my heart </verse>
    <verse value="34"> because I so feared the crowd and so dreaded the contempt of the clans that I kept silent and would not go outside--</verse>
    <verse value="35"> ("Oh, that I had someone to hear me! I sign now my defense--let the Almighty answer me; let my accuser put his indictment in writing. </verse>
    <verse value="36"> Surely I would wear it on my shoulder, I would put it on like a crown. </verse>
    <verse value="37"> I would give him an account of my every step; like a prince I would approach him.)--</verse>
    <verse value="38"> "if my land cries out against me and all its furrows are wet with tears, </verse>
    <verse value="39"> if I have devoured its yield without payment or broken the spirit of its tenants, </verse>
    <verse value="40"> then let briers come up instead of wheat and weeds instead of barley." The words of Job are ended.</verse>
