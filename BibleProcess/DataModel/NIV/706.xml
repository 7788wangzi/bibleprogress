    <verse value="1">In that day, the LORD will punish with his sword, his fierce, great and powerful sword, Leviathan the gliding serpent, Leviathan the coiling serpent; he will slay the monster of the sea.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> In that day-- "Sing about a fruitful vineyard:</verse>
    <verse value="3"> I, the LORD, watch over it; I water it continually. I guard it day and night so that no one may harm it. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> I am not angry. If only there were briers and thorns confronting me! I would march against them in battle; I would set them all on fire. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Or else let them come to me for refuge; let them make peace with me, yes, let them make peace with me."</verse>
    <verse value="6"> In days to come Jacob will take root, Israel will bud and blossom and fill all the world with fruit.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Has [the LORD] struck her as he struck down those who struck her? Has she been killed as those were killed who killed her? </verse>
    <verse value="8"> By warfare and exile you contend with her-- with his fierce blast he drives her out, as on a day the east wind blows. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> By this, then, will Jacob's guilt be atoned for, and this will be the full fruitage of the removal of his sin: When he makes all the altar stones to be like chalk stones crushed to pieces, no Asherah poles or incense altars will be left standing. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> The fortified city stands desolate, an abandoned settlement, forsaken like the desert; there the calves graze, there they lie down; they strip its branches bare. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> When its twigs are dry, they are broken off and women come and make fires with them. For this is a people without understanding; so their Maker has no compassion on them, and their Creator shows them no favor. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> In that day the LORD will thresh from the flowing Euphrates to the Wadi of Egypt, and you, O Israelites, will be gathered up one by one. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> And in that day a great trumpet will sound. Those who were perishing in Assyria and those who were exiled in Egypt will come and worship the LORD on the holy mountain in Jerusalem. </verse>
