    <verse value="1">Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> "Then he sent some more servants and said, 'Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.' </verse>
    <verse value="5"> "But they paid no attention and went off--one to his field, another to his business.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> "Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.' </verse>
    <verse value="10"> So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> "But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> 'Friend,' he asked, 'how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' The man was speechless. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> "Then the king told the attendants, 'Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' </verse>
    <verse value="14"> "For many are invited, but few are chosen." </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. "Teacher," they said, "we know you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?" </verse>
    <verse value="18"> But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, "You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me?</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Show me the coin used for paying the tax." They brought him a denarius,</verse>
    <verse value="20"> and he asked them, "Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?"</verse>
    <verse value="21"> "Caesar's," they replied. Then he said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's." </verse>
    <verse value="22"> When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> "Teacher," they said, "Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and have children for him. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> The same thing happened to the second and third brother, right on down to the seventh.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Finally, the woman died.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?"</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Jesus replied, "You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven. </verse>
    <verse value="31"> But about the resurrection of the dead--have you not read what God said to you,</verse>
    <verse value="32"> 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not the God of the dead but of the living."</verse>
    <verse value="33"> When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. </verse>
    <verse value="34"> Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together. </verse>
    <verse value="35"> One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: </verse>
    <verse value="36"> "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?"</verse>
    <verse value="37"> Jesus replied: " 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' </verse>
    <verse value="38"> This is the first and greatest commandment.</verse>
    <verse value="39"> And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' </verse>
    <verse value="40"> All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments." </verse>
    <verse value="41"> While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</verse>
    <verse value="42"> "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" "The son of David," they replied.</verse>
    <verse value="43"> He said to them, "How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him 'Lord'? For he says,</verse>
    <verse value="44"> " 'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet." ' </verse>
    <verse value="45"> If then David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?"</verse>
    <verse value="46"> No one could say a word in reply, and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions. </verse>
