    <verse value="1">If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> For we know in part and we prophesy in part, </verse>
    <verse value="10"> but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love. </verse>
