    <verse value="1">Then Job replied:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "How long will you torment me and crush me with words? </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Ten times now you have reproached me; shamelessly you attack me. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> If it is true that I have gone astray, my error remains my concern alone. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and use my humiliation against me, </verse>
    <verse value="6"> then know that God has wronged me and drawn his net around me.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> "Though I cry, 'I've been wronged!' I get no response; though I call for help, there is no justice. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> He has blocked my way so I cannot pass; he has shrouded my paths in darkness. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> He tears me down on every side till I am gone; he uproots my hope like a tree. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> His anger burns against me; he counts me among his enemies. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> His troops advance in force; they build a siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> "He has alienated my brothers from me; my acquaintances are completely estranged from me.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> My kinsmen have gone away; my friends have forgotten me. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> My guests and my maidservants count me a stranger; they look upon me as an alien. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> I summon my servant, but he does not answer, though I beg him with my own mouth.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> My breath is offensive to my wife; I am loathsome to my own brothers. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> Even the little boys scorn me; when I appear, they ridicule me. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> All my intimate friends detest me; those I love have turned against me. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> I am nothing but skin and bones; I have escaped with only the skin of my teeth.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> "Have pity on me, my friends, have pity, for the hand of God has struck me. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> Why do you pursue me as God does? Will you never get enough of my flesh?</verse>
    <verse value="23"> "Oh, that my words were recorded, that they were written on a scroll, </verse>
    <verse value="24"> that they were inscribed with an iron tool on lead, or engraved in rock forever!</verse>
    <verse value="25"> I know that my Redeemer lives, and that in the end he will stand upon the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God; </verse>
    <verse value="27"> I myself will see him with my own eyes--I, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!</verse>
    <verse value="28"> "If you say, 'How we will hound him, since the root of the trouble lies in him, ' </verse>
    <verse value="29"> you should fear the sword yourselves; for wrath will bring punishment by the sword, and then you will know that there is judgment. " </verse>
