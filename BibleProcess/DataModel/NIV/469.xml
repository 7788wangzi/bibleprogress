    <verse value="1">"But now, Job, listen to my words; pay attention to everything I say.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> I am about to open my mouth; my words are on the tip of my tongue.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> My words come from an upright heart; my lips sincerely speak what I know. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> The Spirit of God has made me; the breath of the Almighty gives me life.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Answer me then, if you can; prepare yourself and confront me. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> I am just like you before God; I too have been taken from clay. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> No fear of me should alarm you, nor should my hand be heavy upon you.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> "But you have said in my hearing-- I heard the very words--</verse>
    <verse value="9"> 'I am pure and without sin; I am clean and free from guilt. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> Yet God has found fault with me; he considers me his enemy. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> He fastens my feet in shackles; he keeps close watch on all my paths.'</verse>
    <verse value="12"> "But I tell you, in this you are not right, for God is greater than man.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Why do you complain to him that he answers none of man's words?</verse>
    <verse value="14"> For God does speak--now one way, now another-- though man may not perceive it. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men as they slumber in their beds, </verse>
    <verse value="16"> he may speak in their ears and terrify them with warnings, </verse>
    <verse value="17"> to turn man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride, </verse>
    <verse value="18"> to preserve his soul from the pit, his life from perishing by the sword. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> Or a man may be chastened on a bed of pain with constant distress in his bones, </verse>
    <verse value="20"> so that his very being finds food repulsive and his soul loathes the choicest meal. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> His flesh wastes away to nothing, and his bones, once hidden, now stick out. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> His soul draws near to the pit, and his life to the messengers of death.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> "Yet if there is an angel on his side as a mediator, one out of a thousand, to tell a man what is right for him, </verse>
    <verse value="24"> to be gracious to him and say, 'Spare him from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom for him'-- </verse>
    <verse value="25"> then his flesh is renewed like a child's; it is restored as in the days of his youth. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> He prays to God and finds favor with him, he sees God's face and shouts for joy; he is restored by God to his righteous state. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> Then he comes to men and says, 'I sinned, and perverted what was right, but I did not get what I deserved. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> He redeemed my soul from going down to the pit, and I will live to enjoy the light.'</verse>
    <verse value="29"> "God does all these things to a man-- twice, even three times-- </verse>
    <verse value="30"> to turn back his soul from the pit, that the light of life may shine on him.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> "Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak. </verse>
    <verse value="32"> If you have anything to say, answer me; speak up, for I want you to be cleared. </verse>
    <verse value="33"> But if not, then listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom."</verse>
