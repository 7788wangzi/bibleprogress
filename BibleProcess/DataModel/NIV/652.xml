    <verse value="1">Do not envy wicked men, do not desire their company; </verse>
    <verse value="2"> for their hearts plot violence, and their lips talk about making trouble.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> By wisdom a house is built, and through understanding it is established;</verse>
    <verse value="4"> through knowledge its rooms are filled with rare and beautiful treasures.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> A wise man has great power, and a man of knowledge increases strength;</verse>
    <verse value="6"> for waging war you need guidance, and for victory many advisers.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Wisdom is too high for a fool; in the assembly at the gate he has nothing to say.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> He who plots evil will be known as a schemer.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> The schemes of folly are sin, and men detest a mocker.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> If you falter in times of trouble, how small is your strength!</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Rescue those being led away to death; hold back those staggering toward slaughter. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> If you say, "But we knew nothing about this," does not he who weighs the heart perceive it? Does not he who guards your life know it? Will he not repay each person according to what he has done?</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Eat honey, my son, for it is good; honey from the comb is sweet to your taste.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Know also that wisdom is sweet to your soul; if you find it, there is a future hope for you, and your hope will not be cut off.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Do not lie in wait like an outlaw against a righteous man's house, do not raid his dwelling place;</verse>
    <verse value="16"> for though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again, but the wicked are brought down by calamity.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when he stumbles, do not let your heart rejoice, </verse>
    <verse value="18"> or the LORD will see and disapprove and turn his wrath away from him.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Do not fret because of evil men or be envious of the wicked, </verse>
    <verse value="20"> for the evil man has no future hope, and the lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Fear the LORD and the king, my son, and do not join with the rebellious, </verse>
    <verse value="22"> for those two will send sudden destruction upon them, and who knows what calamities they can bring? </verse>
    <verse value="23"> These also are sayings of the wise: To show partiality in judging is not good: </verse>
    <verse value="24"> Whoever says to the guilty, "You are innocent"-- peoples will curse him and nations denounce him. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> But it will go well with those who convict the guilty, and rich blessing will come upon them.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> An honest answer is like a kiss on the lips.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Finish your outdoor work and get your fields ready; after that, build your house.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Do not testify against your neighbor without cause, or use your lips to deceive. </verse>
    <verse value="29"> Do not say, "I'll do to him as he has done to me; I'll pay that man back for what he did."</verse>
    <verse value="30"> I went past the field of the sluggard, past the vineyard of the man who lacks judgment; </verse>
    <verse value="31"> thorns had come up everywhere, the ground was covered with weeds, and the stone wall was in ruins.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> I applied my heart to what I observed and learned a lesson from what I saw:</verse>
    <verse value="33"> A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest--</verse>
    <verse value="34"> and poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity like an armed man. </verse>
