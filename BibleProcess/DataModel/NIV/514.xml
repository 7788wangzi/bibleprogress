    <verse value="1">For the director of music. Of David the servant of the LORD. An oracle is within my heart concerning the sinfulness of the wicked: There is no fear of God before his eyes. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> For in his own eyes he flatters himself too much to detect or hate his sin. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful; he has ceased to be wise and to do good. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Even on his bed he plots evil; he commits himself to a sinful course and does not reject what is wrong.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Your love, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, your faithfulness to the skies. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, your justice like the great deep. O LORD, you preserve both man and beast. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> How priceless is your unfailing love! Both high and low among men find refuge in the shadow of your wings. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> They feast on the abundance of your house; you give them drink from your river of delights. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Continue your love to those who know you, your righteousness to the upright in heart. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> May the foot of the proud not come against me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.</verse>
