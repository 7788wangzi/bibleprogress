    <verse value="1">Then Job replied:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "How you have helped the powerless! How you have saved the arm that is feeble!</verse>
    <verse value="3"> What advice you have offered to one without wisdom! And what great insight you have displayed! </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Who has helped you utter these words? And whose spirit spoke from your mouth?</verse>
    <verse value="5"> "The dead are in deep anguish, those beneath the waters and all that live in them. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Death is naked before God; Destruction lies uncovered. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> He spreads out the northern [skies] over empty space; he suspends the earth over nothing.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> He wraps up the waters in his clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their weight. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> He covers the face of the full moon, spreading his clouds over it. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> He marks out the horizon on the face of the waters for a boundary between light and darkness.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> The pillars of the heavens quake, aghast at his rebuke. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> By his power he churned up the sea; by his wisdom he cut Rahab to pieces. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> By his breath the skies became fair; his hand pierced the gliding serpent. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> And these are but the outer fringe of his works; how faint the whisper we hear of him! Who then can understand the thunder of his power?"</verse>
