    <verse value="1">A [maskil] of Asaph. O my people, hear my teaching; listen to the words of my mouth. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter hidden things, things from of old-- </verse>
    <verse value="3"> what we have heard and known, what our fathers have told us. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> We will not hide them from their children; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD, his power, and the wonders he has done.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel, which he commanded our forefathers to teach their children, </verse>
    <verse value="6"> so the next generation would know them, even the children yet to be born, and they in turn would tell their children. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> They would not be like their forefathers-- a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose hearts were not loyal to God, whose spirits were not faithful to him.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows, turned back on the day of battle;</verse>
    <verse value="10"> they did not keep God's covenant and refused to live by his law. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> They forgot what he had done, the wonders he had shown them. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> He did miracles in the sight of their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> He divided the sea and led them through; he made the water stand firm like a wall. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> He guided them with the cloud by day and with light from the fire all night. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> He split the rocks in the desert and gave them water as abundant as the seas; </verse>
    <verse value="16"> he brought streams out of a rocky crag and made water flow down like rivers.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> But they continued to sin against him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> They willfully put God to the test by demanding the food they craved. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> They spoke against God, saying, "Can God spread a table in the desert? </verse>
    <verse value="20"> When he struck the rock, water gushed out, and streams flowed abundantly. But can he also give us food? Can he supply meat for his people?" </verse>
    <verse value="21"> When the LORD heard them, he was very angry; his fire broke out against Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel, </verse>
    <verse value="22"> for they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> Yet he gave a command to the skies above and opened the doors of the heavens; </verse>
    <verse value="24"> he rained down manna for the people to eat, he gave them the grain of heaven. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> Men ate the bread of angels; he sent them all the food they could eat.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> He let loose the east wind from the heavens and led forth the south wind by his power. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> He rained meat down on them like dust, flying birds like sand on the seashore. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> He made them come down inside their camp, all around their tents.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> They ate till they had more than enough, for he had given them what they craved. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> But before they turned from the food they craved, even while it was still in their mouths, </verse>
    <verse value="31"> God's anger rose against them; he put to death the sturdiest among them, cutting down the young men of Israel.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; in spite of his wonders, they did not believe. </verse>
    <verse value="33"> So he ended their days in futility and their years in terror. </verse>
    <verse value="34"> Whenever God slew them, they would seek him; they eagerly turned to him again. </verse>
    <verse value="35"> They remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High was their Redeemer. </verse>
    <verse value="36"> But then they would flatter him with their mouths, lying to him with their tongues; </verse>
    <verse value="37"> their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his covenant. </verse>
    <verse value="38"> Yet he was merciful; he forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them. Time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath. </verse>
    <verse value="39"> He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return.</verse>
    <verse value="40"> How often they rebelled against him in the desert and grieved him in the wasteland! </verse>
    <verse value="41"> Again and again they put God to the test; they vexed the Holy One of Israel. </verse>
    <verse value="42"> They did not remember his power-- the day he redeemed them from the oppressor, </verse>
    <verse value="43"> the day he displayed his miraculous signs in Egypt, his wonders in the region of Zoan. </verse>
    <verse value="44"> He turned their rivers to blood; they could not drink from their streams. </verse>
    <verse value="45"> He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them. </verse>
    <verse value="46"> He gave their crops to the grasshopper, their produce to the locust. </verse>
    <verse value="47"> He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore-figs with sleet. </verse>
    <verse value="48"> He gave over their cattle to the hail, their livestock to bolts of lightning. </verse>
    <verse value="49"> He unleashed against them his hot anger, his wrath, indignation and hostility-- a band of destroying angels. </verse>
    <verse value="50"> He prepared a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death but gave them over to the plague.</verse>
    <verse value="51"> He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt, the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham. </verse>
    <verse value="52"> But he brought his people out like a flock; he led them like sheep through the desert. </verse>
    <verse value="53"> He guided them safely, so they were unafraid; but the sea engulfed their enemies. </verse>
    <verse value="54"> Thus he brought them to the border of his holy land, to the hill country his right hand had taken.</verse>
    <verse value="55"> He drove out nations before them and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance; he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes.</verse>
    <verse value="56"> But they put God to the test and rebelled against the Most High; they did not keep his statutes.</verse>
    <verse value="57"> Like their fathers they were disloyal and faithless, as unreliable as a faulty bow. </verse>
    <verse value="58"> They angered him with their high places; they aroused his jealousy with their idols. </verse>
    <verse value="59"> When God heard them, he was very angry; he rejected Israel completely. </verse>
    <verse value="60"> He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent he had set up among men. </verse>
    <verse value="61"> He sent [the ark of] his might into captivity, his splendor into the hands of the enemy. </verse>
    <verse value="62"> He gave his people over to the sword; he was very angry with his inheritance. </verse>
    <verse value="63"> Fire consumed their young men, and their maidens had no wedding songs; </verse>
    <verse value="64"> their priests were put to the sword, and their widows could not weep.</verse>
    <verse value="65"> Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, as a man wakes from the stupor of wine.</verse>
    <verse value="66"> He beat back his enemies; he put them to everlasting shame. </verse>
    <verse value="67"> Then he rejected the tents of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim; </verse>
    <verse value="68"> but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved. </verse>
    <verse value="69"> He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that he established forever. </verse>
    <verse value="70"> He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pens; </verse>
    <verse value="71"> from tending the sheep he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of Israel his inheritance. </verse>
    <verse value="72"> And David shepherded them with integrity of heart; with skillful hands he led them. </verse>
