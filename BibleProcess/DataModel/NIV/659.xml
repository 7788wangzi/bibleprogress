    <verse value="1">The sayings of King Lemuel--an oracle his mother taught him: </verse>
    <verse value="2"> "O my son, O son of my womb, O son of my vows, </verse>
    <verse value="3"> do not spend your strength on women, your vigor on those who ruin kings.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> "It is not for kings, O Lemuel-- not for kings to drink wine, not for rulers to crave beer, </verse>
    <verse value="5"> lest they drink and forget what the law decrees, and deprive all the oppressed of their rights. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Give beer to those who are perishing, wine to those who are in anguish; </verse>
    <verse value="7"> let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> "Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy."</verse>
    <verse value="10">  A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> She gets up while it is still dark; she provides food for her family and portions for her servant girls.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> She considers a field and buys it; out of her earnings she plants a vineyard.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> She sets about her work vigorously; her arms are strong for her tasks.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> She sees that her trading is profitable, and her lamp does not go out at night.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> In her hand she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> When it snows, she has no fear for her household; for all of them are clothed in scarlet.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the merchants with sashes.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her:</verse>
    <verse value="29"> "Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all."</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> Give her the reward she has earned, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate. </verse>
