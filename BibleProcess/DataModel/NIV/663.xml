    <verse value="1">Again I looked and saw all the oppression that was taking place under the sun: I saw the tears of the oppressed-- and they have no comforter; power was on the side of their oppressors-- and they have no comforter. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> And I declared that the dead, who had already died, are happier than the living, who are still alive. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> But better than both is he who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> And I saw that all labor and all achievement spring from man's envy of his neighbor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> The fool folds his hands and ruins himself. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Better one handful with tranquillity than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Again I saw something meaningless under the sun:</verse>
    <verse value="8"> There was a man all alone; he had neither son nor brother. There was no end to his toil, yet his eyes were not content with his wealth. "For whom am I toiling," he asked, "and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?" This too is meaningless-- a miserable business!</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their work:</verse>
    <verse value="10"> If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up!</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone?</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Better a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to take warning.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> The youth may have come from prison to the kingship, or he may have been born in poverty within his kingdom.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> I saw that all who lived and walked under the sun followed the youth, the king's successor.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> There was no end to all the people who were before them. But those who came later were not pleased with the successor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</verse>
