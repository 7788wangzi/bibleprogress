    <verse value="7"> Altogether, Abraham lived a hundred and seventy-five years. </verse>

    <verse value="9"> His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite, </verse>

    <verse value="18"> His descendants settled in the area from Havilah to Shur, near the border of Egypt, as you go toward Asshur. And they lived in hostility toward all their brothers.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> This is the account of Abraham's son Isaac. Abraham became the father of Isaac,</verse>
    <verse value="20"> and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram and sister of Laban the Aramean. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was barren. The LORD answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> The babies jostled each other within her, and she said, "Why is this happening to me?" So she went to inquire of the LORD. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> The LORD said to her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be separated; one people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger." </verse>
    <verse value="24"> When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> The first to come out was red, and his whole body was like a hairy garment; so they named him Esau. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> After this, his brother came out, with his hand grasping Esau's heel; so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> The boys grew up, and Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open country, while Jacob was a quiet man, staying among the tents. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob. </verse>
    <verse value="29"> Once when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> He said to Jacob, "Quick, let me have some of that red stew! I'm famished!" (That is why he was also called Edom.)</verse>
    <verse value="31"> Jacob replied, "First sell me your birthright." </verse>
    <verse value="32"> "Look, I am about to die," Esau said. "What good is the birthright to me?"</verse>
    <verse value="33"> But Jacob said, "Swear to me first." So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthright to Jacob. </verse>
    <verse value="34"> Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew. He ate and drank, and then got up and left. So Esau despised his birthright.</verse>
