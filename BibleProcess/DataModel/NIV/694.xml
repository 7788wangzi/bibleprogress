    <verse value="1">An oracle concerning Moab: Ar in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night! Kir in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night!</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Dibon goes up to its temple, to its high places to weep; Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba. Every head is shaved and every beard cut off.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> In the streets they wear sackcloth; on the roofs and in the public squares they all wail, prostrate with weeping. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, their voices are heard all the way to Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab cry out, and their hearts are faint.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> My heart cries out over Moab; her fugitives flee as far as Zoar, as far as Eglath Shelishiyah. They go up the way to Luhith, weeping as they go; on the road to Horonaim they lament their destruction.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> The waters of Nimrim are dried up and the grass is withered; the vegetation is gone and nothing green is left. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> So the wealth they have acquired and stored up they carry away over the Ravine of the Poplars. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> Their outcry echoes along the border of Moab; their wailing reaches as far as Eglaim, their lamentation as far as Beer Elim. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Dimon's waters are full of blood, but I will bring still more upon Dimon-- a lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon those who remain in the land.</verse>
