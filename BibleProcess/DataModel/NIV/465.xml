    <verse value="1">Job continued his discourse:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "How I long for the months gone by, for the days when God watched over me, </verse>
    <verse value="3"> when his lamp shone upon my head and by his light I walked through darkness! </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Oh, for the days when I was in my prime, when God's intimate friendship blessed my house, </verse>
    <verse value="5"> when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me, </verse>
    <verse value="6"> when my path was drenched with cream and the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> "When I went to the gate of the city and took my seat in the public square, </verse>
    <verse value="8"> the young men saw me and stepped aside and the old men rose to their feet;</verse>
    <verse value="9"> the chief men refrained from speaking and covered their mouths with their hands; </verse>
    <verse value="10"> the voices of the nobles were hushed, and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Whoever heard me spoke well of me, and those who saw me commended me, </verse>
    <verse value="12"> because I rescued the poor who cried for help, and the fatherless who had none to assist him. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> The man who was dying blessed me; I made the widow's heart sing. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> I put on righteousness as my clothing; justice was my robe and my turban. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> I was a father to the needy; I took up the case of the stranger. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> I broke the fangs of the wicked and snatched the victims from their teeth.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> "I thought, 'I will die in my own house, my days as numerous as the grains of sand. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> My roots will reach to the water, and the dew will lie all night on my branches.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> My glory will remain fresh in me, the bow ever new in my hand.'</verse>
    <verse value="21"> "Men listened to me expectantly, waiting in silence for my counsel. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> After I had spoken, they spoke no more; my words fell gently on their ears. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> They waited for me as for showers and drank in my words as the spring rain. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> When I smiled at them, they scarcely believed it; the light of my face was precious to them.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> I chose the way for them and sat as their chief; I dwelt as a king among his troops; I was like one who comforts mourners.</verse>
