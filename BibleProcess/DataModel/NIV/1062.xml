    <verse value="1">I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a servant of the church in Cenchrea. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> I ask you to receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of the saints and to give her any help she may need from you, for she has been a great help to many people, including me.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> They risked their lives for me. Not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Greet also the church that meets at their house. Greet my dear friend Epenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Asia.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Greet Mary, who worked very hard for you.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Greet Andronicus and Junias, my relatives who have been in prison with me. They are outstanding among the apostles, and they were in Christ before I was. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> Greet Ampliatus, whom I love in the Lord.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Greet Apelles, tested and approved in Christ. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus.</verse>

    <verse value="17"> I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> Everyone has heard about your obedience, so I am full of joy over you; but I want you to be wise about what is good, and innocent about what is evil. </verse>

    <verse value="24">
    </verse>
    <verse value="25"> Now to him who is able to establish you by my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past, </verse>
    <verse value="26"> but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God, so that all nations might believe and obey him-- </verse>
    <verse value="27"> to the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ! Amen. </verse>
