    <verse value="1">Then Job replied:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Indeed, I know that this is true. But how can a mortal be righteous before God?</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Though one wished to dispute with him, he could not answer him one time out of a thousand. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> His wisdom is profound, his power is vast. Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?</verse>
    <verse value="5"> He moves mountains without their knowing it and overturns them in his anger. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> He shakes the earth from its place and makes its pillars tremble. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> He speaks to the sun and it does not shine; he seals off the light of the stars. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the south. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> When he passes me, I cannot see him; when he goes by, I cannot perceive him.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> If he snatches away, who can stop him? Who can say to him, 'What are you doing?' </verse>
    <verse value="13"> God does not restrain his anger; even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> "How then can I dispute with him? How can I find words to argue with him? </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Though I were innocent, I could not answer him; I could only plead with my Judge for mercy. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> Even if I summoned him and he responded, I do not believe he would give me a hearing. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> He would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds for no reason. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> He would not let me regain my breath but would overwhelm me with misery. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> If it is a matter of strength, he is mighty! And if it is a matter of justice, who will summon him?</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would pronounce me guilty.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> "Although I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; I despise my own life. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> It is all the same; that is why I say, 'He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.' </verse>
    <verse value="23"> When a scourge brings sudden death, he mocks the despair of the innocent. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> When a land falls into the hands of the wicked, he blindfolds its judges. If it is not he, then who is it?</verse>
    <verse value="25"> "My days are swifter than a runner; they fly away without a glimpse of joy. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> They skim past like boats of papyrus, like eagles swooping down on their prey. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will change my expression, and smile,' </verse>
    <verse value="28"> I still dread all my sufferings, for I know you will not hold me innocent. </verse>
    <verse value="29"> Since I am already found guilty, why should I struggle in vain? </verse>
    <verse value="30"> Even if I washed myself with soap and my hands with washing soda, </verse>
    <verse value="31"> you would plunge me into a slime pit so that even my clothes would detest me.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> "He is not a man like me that I might answer him, that we might confront each other in court. </verse>
    <verse value="33"> If only there were someone to arbitrate between us, to lay his hand upon us both, </verse>
    <verse value="34"> someone to remove God's rod from me, so that his terror would frighten me no more. </verse>
    <verse value="35"> Then I would speak up without fear of him, but as it now stands with me, I cannot.</verse>
