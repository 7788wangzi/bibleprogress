    <verse value="1">"But now they mock me, men younger than I, whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> Of what use was the strength of their hands to me, since their vigor had gone from them?</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Haggard from want and hunger, they roamed the parched land in desolate wastelands at night. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> In the brush they gathered salt herbs, and their food was the root of the broom tree. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> They were banished from their fellow men, shouted at as if they were thieves.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> They were forced to live in the dry stream beds, among the rocks and in holes in the ground. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> They brayed among the bushes and huddled in the undergrowth. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> A base and nameless brood, they were driven out of the land.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> "And now their sons mock me in song; I have become a byword among them. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> They detest me and keep their distance; they do not hesitate to spit in my face. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Now that God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me, they throw off restraint in my presence.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> On my right the tribe attacks; they lay snares for my feet, they build their siege ramps against me. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> They break up my road; they succeed in destroying me-- without anyone's helping them. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> They advance as through a gaping breach; amid the ruins they come rolling in. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Terrors overwhelm me; my dignity is driven away as by the wind, my safety vanishes like a cloud.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> "And now my life ebbs away; days of suffering grip me. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> Night pierces my bones; my gnawing pains never rest. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> In his great power [God] becomes like clothing to me; he binds me like the neck of my garment.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> He throws me into the mud, and I am reduced to dust and ashes.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> "I cry out to you, O God, but you do not answer; I stand up, but you merely look at me. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> You turn on me ruthlessly; with the might of your hand you attack me. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> You snatch me up and drive me before the wind; you toss me about in the storm. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> I know you will bring me down to death, to the place appointed for all the living.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> "Surely no one lays a hand on a broken man when he cries for help in his distress.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Have I not wept for those in trouble? Has not my soul grieved for the poor? </verse>
    <verse value="26"> Yet when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, then came darkness.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> The churning inside me never stops; days of suffering confront me. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> I go about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> I have become a brother of jackals, a companion of owls. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> My skin grows black and peels; my body burns with fever. </verse>
    <verse value="31"> My harp is tuned to mourning, and my flute to the sound of wailing.</verse>
