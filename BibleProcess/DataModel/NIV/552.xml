    <verse value="1">A [maskil] of Asaph. Why have you rejected us forever, O God? Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture? </verse>
    <verse value="2"> Remember the people you purchased of old, the tribe of your inheritance, whom you redeemed-- Mount Zion, where you dwelt. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Turn your steps toward these everlasting ruins, all this destruction the enemy has brought on the sanctuary.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Your foes roared in the place where you met with us; they set up their standards as signs. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> They behaved like men wielding axes to cut through a thicket of trees. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> They smashed all the carved paneling with their axes and hatchets. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> They burned your sanctuary to the ground; they defiled the dwelling place of your Name.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> They said in their hearts, "We will crush them completely!" They burned every place where God was worshiped in the land.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> We are given no miraculous signs; no prophets are left, and none of us knows how long this will be.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> How long will the enemy mock you, O God? Will the foe revile your name forever? </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand? Take it from the folds of your garment and destroy them!</verse>
    <verse value="12"> But you, O God, are my king from of old; you bring salvation upon the earth. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> It was you who split open the sea by your power; you broke the heads of the monster in the waters. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> It was you who crushed the heads of Leviathan and gave him as food to the creatures of the desert. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> It was you who opened up springs and streams; you dried up the ever flowing rivers. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> The day is yours, and yours also the night; you established the sun and moon. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> It was you who set all the boundaries of the earth; you made both summer and winter.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Remember how the enemy has mocked you, O LORD, how foolish people have reviled your name. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> Do not hand over the life of your dove to wild beasts; do not forget the lives of your afflicted people forever. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> Have regard for your covenant, because haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> Do not let the oppressed retreat in disgrace; may the poor and needy praise your name.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Rise up, O God, and defend your cause; remember how fools mock you all day long. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> Do not ignore the clamor of your adversaries, the uproar of your enemies, which rises continually. </verse>
