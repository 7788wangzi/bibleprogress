    <verse value="1">For the director of music. For flutes. A psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my sighing. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> Listen to my cry for help, my King and my God, for to you I pray. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> In the morning, O LORD, you hear my voice; in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait in expectation.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> You are not a God who takes pleasure in evil; with you the wicked cannot dwell. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> The arrogant cannot stand in your presence; you hate all who do wrong. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> You destroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the LORD abhors.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> But I, by your great mercy, will come into your house; in reverence will I bow down toward your holy temple.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies-- make straight your way before me.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Not a word from their mouth can be trusted; their heart is filled with destruction. Their throat is an open grave; with their tongue they speak deceit.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Declare them guilty, O God! Let their intrigues be their downfall. Banish them for their many sins, for they have rebelled against you.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> But let all who take refuge in you be glad; let them ever sing for joy. Spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may rejoice in you. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> For surely, O LORD, you bless the righteous; you surround them with your favor as with a shield. </verse>
