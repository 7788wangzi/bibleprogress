    <verse value="1">Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name; make known among the nations what he has done.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all his wonderful acts. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Look to the LORD and his strength; seek his face always.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Remember the wonders he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced, </verse>
    <verse value="6"> O descendants of Abraham his servant, O sons of Jacob, his chosen ones. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> He remembers his covenant forever, the word he commanded, for a thousand generations, </verse>
    <verse value="9"> the covenant he made with Abraham, the oath he swore to Isaac. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant: </verse>
    <verse value="11"> "To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion you will inherit."</verse>
    <verse value="12"> When they were but few in number, few indeed, and strangers in it, </verse>
    <verse value="13"> they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> He allowed no one to oppress them; for their sake he rebuked kings: </verse>
    <verse value="15"> "Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm."</verse>
    <verse value="16"> He called down famine on the land and destroyed all their supplies of food; </verse>
    <verse value="17"> and he sent a man before them-- Joseph, sold as a slave. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> They bruised his feet with shackles, his neck was put in irons, </verse>
    <verse value="19"> till what he foretold came to pass, till the word of the LORD proved him true. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> The king sent and released him, the ruler of peoples set him free. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> He made him master of his household, ruler over all he possessed,</verse>
    <verse value="22"> to instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Then Israel entered Egypt; Jacob lived as an alien in the land of Ham. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> The LORD made his people very fruitful; he made them too numerous for their foes, </verse>
    <verse value="25"> whose hearts he turned to hate his people, to conspire against his servants. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> They performed his miraculous signs among them, his wonders in the land of Ham. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> He sent darkness and made the land dark-- for had they not rebelled against his words?</verse>
    <verse value="29"> He turned their waters into blood, causing their fish to die. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> Their land teemed with frogs, which went up into the bedrooms of their rulers. </verse>
    <verse value="31"> He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> He turned their rain into hail, with lightning throughout their land; </verse>
    <verse value="33"> he struck down their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country. </verse>
    <verse value="34"> He spoke, and the locusts came, grasshoppers without number; </verse>
    <verse value="35"> they ate up every green thing in their land, ate up the produce of their soil.</verse>
    <verse value="36"> Then he struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their manhood.</verse>
    <verse value="37"> He brought out Israel, laden with silver and gold, and from among their tribes no one faltered. </verse>
    <verse value="38"> Egypt was glad when they left, because dread of Israel had fallen on them. </verse>
    <verse value="39"> He spread out a cloud as a covering, and a fire to give light at night.</verse>
    <verse value="40"> They asked, and he brought them quail and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. </verse>
    <verse value="41"> He opened the rock, and water gushed out; like a river it flowed in the desert.</verse>
    <verse value="42"> For he remembered his holy promise given to his servant Abraham. </verse>
    <verse value="43"> He brought out his people with rejoicing, his chosen ones with shouts of joy;</verse>
    <verse value="44"> he gave them the lands of the nations, and they fell heir to what others had toiled for-- </verse>
    <verse value="45"> that they might keep his precepts and observe his laws. Praise the LORD.</verse>
