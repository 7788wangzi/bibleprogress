    <verse value="1">Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Here a great number of disabled people used to lie--the blind, the lame, the paralyzed. </verse>
    <verse value="4">
    </verse>
    <verse value="5"> One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, "Do you want to get well?"</verse>
    <verse value="7"> "Sir," the invalid replied, "I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me."</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Then Jesus said to him, "Get up! Pick up your mat and walk." </verse>
    <verse value="9"> At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath, </verse>
    <verse value="10"> and so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, "It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat." </verse>
    <verse value="11"> But he replied, "The man who made me well said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'"</verse>
    <verse value="12"> So they asked him, "Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?"</verse>
    <verse value="13"> The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, "See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you." </verse>
    <verse value="15"> The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews persecuted him.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Jesus said to them, "My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working." </verse>
    <verse value="18"> For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Jesus gave them this answer: "I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, to your amazement he will show him even greater things than these. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son, </verse>
    <verse value="23"> that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> "I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> I tell you the truth, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> "Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice </verse>
    <verse value="29"> and come out--those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me. </verse>
    <verse value="31"> "If I testify about myself, my testimony is not valid. </verse>
    <verse value="32"> There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is valid. </verse>
    <verse value="33"> "You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth. </verse>
    <verse value="34"> Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved. </verse>
    <verse value="35"> John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light. </verse>
    <verse value="36"> "I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the very work that the Father has given me to finish, and which I am doing, testifies that the Father has sent me. </verse>
    <verse value="37"> And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form, </verse>
    <verse value="38"> nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent. </verse>
    <verse value="39"> You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures that testify about me, </verse>
    <verse value="40"> yet you refuse to come to me to have life. </verse>
    <verse value="41"> "I do not accept praise from men, </verse>
    <verse value="42"> but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts.</verse>
    <verse value="43"> I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him.</verse>
    <verse value="44"> How can you believe if you accept praise from one another, yet make no effort to obtain the praise that comes from the only God?</verse>
    <verse value="45"> "But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set. </verse>
    <verse value="46"> If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me. </verse>
    <verse value="47"> But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?" </verse>
