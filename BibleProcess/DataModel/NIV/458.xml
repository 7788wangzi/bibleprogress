    <verse value="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Can a man be of benefit to God? Can even a wise man benefit him? </verse>
    <verse value="3"> What pleasure would it give the Almighty if you were righteous? What would he gain if your ways were blameless?</verse>
    <verse value="4"> "Is it for your piety that he rebukes you and brings charges against you? </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Is not your wickedness great? Are not your sins endless? </verse>
    <verse value="6"> You demanded security from your brothers for no reason; you stripped men of their clothing, leaving them naked.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> You gave no water to the weary and you withheld food from the hungry, </verse>
    <verse value="8"> though you were a powerful man, owning land-- an honored man, living on it. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> And you sent widows away empty-handed and broke the strength of the fatherless. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> That is why snares are all around you, why sudden peril terrifies you, </verse>
    <verse value="11"> why it is so dark you cannot see, and why a flood of water covers you.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> "Is not God in the heights of heaven? And see how lofty are the highest stars!</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Yet you say, 'What does God know? Does he judge through such darkness? </verse>
    <verse value="14"> Thick clouds veil him, so he does not see us as he goes about in the vaulted heavens.' </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Will you keep to the old path that evil men have trod? </verse>
    <verse value="16"> They were carried off before their time, their foundations washed away by a flood.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> They said to God, 'Leave us alone! What can the Almighty do to us?' </verse>
    <verse value="18"> Yet it was he who filled their houses with good things, so I stand aloof from the counsel of the wicked.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> "The righteous see their ruin and rejoice; the innocent mock them, saying, </verse>
    <verse value="20"> 'Surely our foes are destroyed, and fire devours their wealth.'</verse>
    <verse value="21"> "Submit to God and be at peace with him; in this way prosperity will come to you. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> Accept instruction from his mouth and lay up his words in your heart. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored: If you remove wickedness far from your tent </verse>
    <verse value="24"> and assign your nuggets to the dust, your gold of Ophir to the rocks in the ravines, </verse>
    <verse value="25"> then the Almighty will be your gold, the choicest silver for you. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> Surely then you will find delight in the Almighty and will lift up your face to God. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> You will pray to him, and he will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> What you decide on will be done, and light will shine on your ways. </verse>
    <verse value="29"> When men are brought low and you say, 'Lift them up!' then he will save the downcast. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> He will deliver even one who is not innocent, who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands." </verse>
