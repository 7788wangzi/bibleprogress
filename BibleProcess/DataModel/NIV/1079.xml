    <verse value="1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, To the church of God in Corinth, together with all the saints throughout Achaia:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, </verse>
    <verse value="4"> who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about the hardships we suffered in the province of Asia. We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired even of life. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Indeed, in our hearts we felt the sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us, </verse>
    <verse value="11"> as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> Now this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you, in the holiness and sincerity that are from God. We have done so not according to worldly wisdom but according to God's grace.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> For we do not write you anything you cannot read or understand. And I hope that,</verse>
    <verse value="14"> as you have understood us in part, you will come to understand fully that you can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Because I was confident of this, I planned to visit you first so that you might benefit twice. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> When I planned this, did I do it lightly? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath I say, "Yes, yes" and "No, no"? </verse>
    <verse value="18"> But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not "Yes" and "No." </verse>
    <verse value="19"> For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by me and Silas and Timothy, was not "Yes" and "No," but in him it has always been "Yes." </verse>
    <verse value="20"> For no matter how many promises God has made, they are "Yes" in Christ. And so through him the "Amen" is spoken by us to the glory of God. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us, </verse>
    <verse value="22"> set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> I call God as my witness that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, because it is by faith you stand firm. </verse>
