    <verse value="1">Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "When will you end these speeches? Be sensible, and then we can talk. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Why are we regarded as cattle and considered stupid in your sight?</verse>
    <verse value="4"> You who tear yourself to pieces in your anger, is the earth to be abandoned for your sake? Or must the rocks be moved from their place?</verse>
    <verse value="5"> "The lamp of the wicked is snuffed out; the flame of his fire stops burning. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> The light in his tent becomes dark; the lamp beside him goes out. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> The vigor of his step is weakened; his own schemes throw him down. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> His feet thrust him into a net and he wanders into its mesh. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare holds him fast. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> A noose is hidden for him on the ground; a trap lies in his path.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Terrors startle him on every side and dog his every step. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> Calamity is hungry for him; disaster is ready for him when he falls. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> It eats away parts of his skin; death's firstborn devours his limbs. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> He is torn from the security of his tent and marched off to the king of terrors. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Fire resides in his tent; burning sulfur is scattered over his dwelling. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> His roots dry up below and his branches wither above. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> The memory of him perishes from the earth; he has no name in the land. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> He is driven from light into darkness and is banished from the world.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> He has no offspring or descendants among his people, no survivor where once he lived. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> Men of the west are appalled at his fate; men of the east are seized with horror. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> Surely such is the dwelling of an evil man; such is the place of one who knows not God." </verse>
