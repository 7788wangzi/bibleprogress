    <verse value="1">The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, </verse>
    <verse value="5"> because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> If you point these things out to the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, brought up in the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives' tales; rather, train yourself to be godly. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance </verse>
    <verse value="10"> (and for this we labor and strive), that we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, and especially of those who believe. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Command and teach these things. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through a prophetic message when the body of elders laid their hands on you. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may see your progress.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.</verse>
