    <verse value="2"> They have given the dead bodies of your servants as food to the birds of the air, the flesh of your saints to the beasts of the earth. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> They have poured out blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there is no one to bury the dead. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> We are objects of reproach to our neighbors, of scorn and derision to those around us.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> How long, O LORD? Will you be angry forever? How long will your jealousy burn like fire? </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the kingdoms that do not call on your name; </verse>
    <verse value="7"> for they have devoured Jacob and destroyed his homeland. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> Do not hold against us the sins of the fathers; may your mercy come quickly to meet us, for we are in desperate need.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Help us, O God our Savior, for the glory of your name; deliver us and forgive our sins for your name's sake. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Before our eyes, make known among the nations that you avenge the outpoured blood of your servants.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> May the groans of the prisoners come before you; by the strength of your arm preserve those condemned to die.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Pay back into the laps of our neighbors seven times the reproach they have hurled at you, O Lord. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> Then we your people, the sheep of your pasture, will praise you forever; from generation to generation we will recount your praise. </verse>
