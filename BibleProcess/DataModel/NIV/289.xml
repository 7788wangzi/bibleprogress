    <verse value="1">David sang to the LORD the words of this song when the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> He said: "The LORD is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; </verse>
    <verse value="3"> my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield and the horn of my salvation. He is my stronghold, my refuge and my savior-- from violent men you save me. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> I call to the LORD, who is worthy of praise, and I am saved from my enemies.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> "The waves of death swirled about me; the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> The cords of the grave coiled around me; the snares of death confronted me. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> In my distress I called to the LORD; I called out to my God. From his temple he heard my voice; my cry came to his ears.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> "The earth trembled and quaked, the foundations of the heavens shook; they trembled because he was angry. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> He parted the heavens and came down; dark clouds were under his feet. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> He mounted the cherubim and flew; he soared on the wings of the wind. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> He made darkness his canopy around him-- the dark rain clouds of the sky. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> Out of the brightness of his presence bolts of lightning blazed forth.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> The LORD thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> He shot arrows and scattered [the enemies], bolts of lightning and routed them.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> The valleys of the sea were exposed and the foundations of the earth laid bare at the rebuke of the LORD, at the blast of breath from his nostrils.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> "He reached down from on high and took hold of me; he drew me out of deep waters. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from my foes, who were too strong for me. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> They confronted me in the day of my disaster, but the LORD was my support. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> He brought me out into a spacious place; he rescued me because he delighted in me.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> "The LORD has dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> For I have kept the ways of the LORD; I have not done evil by turning from my God. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> All his laws are before me; I have not turned away from his decrees. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> I have been blameless before him and have kept myself from sin. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness in his sight.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> "To the faithful you show yourself faithful, to the blameless you show yourself blameless,</verse>
    <verse value="27"> to the pure you show yourself pure, but to the crooked you show yourself shrewd. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> You save the humble, but your eyes are on the haughty to bring them low. </verse>
    <verse value="29"> You are my lamp, O LORD; the LORD turns my darkness into light. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> With your help I can advance against a troop; with my God I can scale a wall.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> "As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is flawless. He is a shield for all who take refuge in him. </verse>
    <verse value="32"> For who is God besides the LORD? And who is the Rock except our God? </verse>
    <verse value="33"> It is God who arms me with strength and makes my way perfect. </verse>
    <verse value="34"> He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; he enables me to stand on the heights. </verse>
    <verse value="35"> He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze. </verse>
    <verse value="36"> You give me your shield of victory; you stoop down to make me great. </verse>
    <verse value="37"> You broaden the path beneath me, so that my ankles do not turn.</verse>
    <verse value="38"> "I pursued my enemies and crushed them; I did not turn back till they were destroyed.</verse>
    <verse value="39"> I crushed them completely, and they could not rise; they fell beneath my feet. </verse>
    <verse value="40"> You armed me with strength for battle; you made my adversaries bow at my feet. </verse>
    <verse value="41"> You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, and I destroyed my foes. </verse>
    <verse value="42"> They cried for help, but there was no one to save them-- to the LORD, but he did not answer. </verse>
    <verse value="43"> I beat them as fine as the dust of the earth; I pounded and trampled them like mud in the streets.</verse>
    <verse value="44"> "You have delivered me from the attacks of my people; you have preserved me as the head of nations. People I did not know are subject to me, </verse>
    <verse value="45"> and foreigners come cringing to me; as soon as they hear me, they obey me. </verse>
    <verse value="46"> They all lose heart; they come trembling from their strongholds.</verse>
    <verse value="47"> "The LORD lives! Praise be to my Rock! Exalted be God, the Rock, my Savior! </verse>
    <verse value="48"> He is the God who avenges me, who puts the nations under me, </verse>
    <verse value="49"> who sets me free from my enemies. You exalted me above my foes; from violent men you rescued me.</verse>
    <verse value="50"> Therefore I will praise you, O LORD, among the nations; I will sing praises to your name. </verse>
    <verse value="51"> He gives his king great victories; he shows unfailing kindness to his anointed, to David and his descendants forever." </verse>
