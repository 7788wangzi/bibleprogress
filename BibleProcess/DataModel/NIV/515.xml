    <verse value="1"> Of David. Do not fret because of evil men or be envious of those who do wrong; </verse>
    <verse value="2"> for like the grass they will soon wither, like green plants they will soon die away.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Trust in the LORD and do good; dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him and he will do this: </verse>
    <verse value="6"> He will make your righteousness shine like the dawn, the justice of your cause like the noonday sun.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him; do not fret when men succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Refrain from anger and turn from wrath; do not fret--it leads only to evil. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> For evil men will be cut off, but those who hope in the LORD will inherit the land.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> A little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look for them, they will not be found. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> But the meek will inherit the land and enjoy great peace.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them; </verse>
    <verse value="13"> but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose ways are upright. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> But their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Better the little that the righteous have than the wealth of many wicked; </verse>
    <verse value="17"> for the power of the wicked will be broken, but the LORD upholds the righteous.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> The days of the blameless are known to the LORD, and their inheritance will endure forever. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> In times of disaster they will not wither; in days of famine they will enjoy plenty.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> But the wicked will perish: The LORD's enemies will be like the beauty of the fields, they will vanish--vanish like smoke.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> The wicked borrow and do not repay, but the righteous give generously; </verse>
    <verse value="22"> those the LORD blesses will inherit the land, but those he curses will be cut off.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> If the LORD delights in a man's way, he makes his steps firm; </verse>
    <verse value="24"> though he stumble, he will not fall, for the LORD upholds him with his hand.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> They are always generous and lend freely; their children will be blessed.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Turn from evil and do good; then you will dwell in the land forever. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> For the LORD loves the just and will not forsake his faithful ones. They will be protected forever, but the offspring of the wicked will be cut off;</verse>
    <verse value="29"> the righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> The mouth of the righteous man utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks what is just. </verse>
    <verse value="31"> The law of his God is in his heart; his feet do not slip.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> The wicked lie in wait for the righteous, seeking their very lives; </verse>
    <verse value="33"> but the LORD will not leave them in their power or let them be condemned when brought to trial.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> Wait for the LORD and keep his way. He will exalt you to inherit the land; when the wicked are cut off, you will see it.</verse>
    <verse value="35"> I have seen a wicked and ruthless man flourishing like a green tree in its native soil, </verse>
    <verse value="36"> but he soon passed away and was no more; though I looked for him, he could not be found.</verse>
    <verse value="37"> Consider the blameless, observe the upright; there is a future for the man of peace. </verse>
    <verse value="38"> But all sinners will be destroyed; the future of the wicked will be cut off.</verse>
    <verse value="39"> The salvation of the righteous comes from the LORD; he is their stronghold in time of trouble. </verse>
    <verse value="40"> The LORD helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they take refuge in him.</verse>
