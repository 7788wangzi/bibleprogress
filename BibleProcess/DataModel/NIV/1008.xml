    <verse value="1">Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> So the sisters sent word to Jesus, "Lord, the one you love is sick." </verse>
    <verse value="4"> When he heard this, Jesus said, "This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God's glory so that God's Son may be glorified through it." </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Yet when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Then he said to his disciples, "Let us go back to Judea." </verse>
    <verse value="8"> "But Rabbi," they said, "a short while ago the Jews tried to stone you, and yet you are going back there?" </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours of daylight? A man who walks by day will not stumble, for he sees by this world's light. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> It is when he walks by night that he stumbles, for he has no light."</verse>
    <verse value="11"> After he had said this, he went on to tell them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him up." </verse>
    <verse value="12"> His disciples replied, "Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better."</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Jesus had been speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> So then he told them plainly, "Lazarus is dead,</verse>
    <verse value="15"> and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him."</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Then Thomas (called Didymus) said to the rest of the disciples, "Let us also go, that we may die with him." </verse>
    <verse value="17"> On his arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem, </verse>
    <verse value="19"> and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> "Lord," Martha said to Jesus, "if you had been here, my brother would not have died. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask." </verse>
    <verse value="23"> Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Martha answered, "I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies; </verse>
    <verse value="26"> and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?" </verse>
    <verse value="27"> "Yes, Lord," she told him, "I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world." </verse>
    <verse value="28"> And after she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. "The Teacher is here," she said, "and is asking for you." </verse>
    <verse value="29"> When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there. </verse>
    <verse value="32"> When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died." </verse>
    <verse value="33"> When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. </verse>
    <verse value="34"> "Where have you laid him?" he asked. "Come and see, Lord," they replied.</verse>
    <verse value="35"> Jesus wept. </verse>
    <verse value="36"> Then the Jews said, "See how he loved him!" </verse>
    <verse value="37"> But some of them said, "Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?" </verse>
    <verse value="38"> Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance. </verse>
    <verse value="39"> "Take away the stone," he said. "But, Lord," said Martha, the sister of the dead man, "by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days." </verse>
    <verse value="40"> Then Jesus said, "Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?" </verse>
    <verse value="41"> So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, "Father, I thank you that you have heard me. </verse>
    <verse value="42"> I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me." </verse>
    <verse value="43"> When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!" </verse>
    <verse value="44"> The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, "Take off the grave clothes and let him go." </verse>
    <verse value="45"> Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him. </verse>
    <verse value="46"> But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</verse>
    <verse value="47"> Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. "What are we accomplishing?" they asked. "Here is this man performing many miraculous signs. </verse>
    <verse value="48"> If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation." </verse>
    <verse value="49"> Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, "You know nothing at all! </verse>
    <verse value="50"> You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish." </verse>
    <verse value="51"> He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation,</verse>
    <verse value="52"> and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one. </verse>
    <verse value="53"> So from that day on they plotted to take his life. </verse>
    <verse value="54"> Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the Jews. Instead he withdrew to a region near the desert, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples. </verse>
    <verse value="55"> When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover. </verse>
    <verse value="56"> They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple area they asked one another, "What do you think? Isn't he coming to the Feast at all?" </verse>
    <verse value="57"> But the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone found out where Jesus was, he should report it so that they might arrest him.</verse>
