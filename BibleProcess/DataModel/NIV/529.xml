    <verse value="3"> For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you are proved right when you speak and justified when you judge. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Surely you desire truth in the inner parts; you teach me wisdom in the inmost place.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.</verse>
