    <verse value="1">The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD; he directs it like a watercourse wherever he pleases.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> All a man's ways seem right to him, but the LORD weighs the heart.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> To do what is right and just is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Haughty eyes and a proud heart, the lamp of the wicked, are sin!</verse>
    <verse value="5"> The plans of the diligent lead to profit as surely as haste leads to poverty.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> A fortune made by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and a deadly snare.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> The violence of the wicked will drag them away, for they refuse to do what is right.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> The way of the guilty is devious, but the conduct of the innocent is upright.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> The wicked man craves evil; his neighbor gets no mercy from him.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> When a mocker is punished, the simple gain wisdom; when a wise man is instructed, he gets knowledge.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> The Righteous One takes note of the house of the wicked and brings the wicked to ruin.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> If a man shuts his ears to the cry of the poor, he too will cry out and not be answered.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> A gift given in secret soothes anger, and a bribe concealed in the cloak pacifies great wrath.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous but terror to evildoers.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> A man who strays from the path of understanding comes to rest in the company of the dead.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> He who loves pleasure will become poor; whoever loves wine and oil will never be rich.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> The wicked become a ransom for the righteous, and the unfaithful for the upright.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Better to live in a desert than with a quarrelsome and ill-tempered wife.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> In the house of the wise are stores of choice food and oil, but a foolish man devours all he has.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> He who pursues righteousness and love finds life, prosperity and honor.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> A wise man attacks the city of the mighty and pulls down the stronghold in which they trust.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> He who guards his mouth and his tongue keeps himself from calamity.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> The proud and arrogant man--"Mocker" is his name; he behaves with overweening pride.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> The sluggard's craving will be the death of him, because his hands refuse to work.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> All day long he craves for more, but the righteous give without sparing.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable-- how much more so when brought with evil intent!</verse>
    <verse value="28"> A false witness will perish, and whoever listens to him will be destroyed forever.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> A wicked man puts up a bold front, but an upright man gives thought to his ways.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan that can succeed against the LORD.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> The horse is made ready for the day of battle, but victory rests with the LORD.</verse>
