    <verse value="1">"Make the tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn, with cherubim worked into them by a skilled craftsman. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> All the curtains are to be the same size--twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Join five of the curtains together, and do the same with the other five.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Make loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and do the same with the end curtain in the other set.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Make fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the other set, with the loops opposite each other.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Then make fifty gold clasps and use them to fasten the curtains together so that the tabernacle is a unit. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> "Make curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle--eleven altogether.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> All eleven curtains are to be the same size--thirty cubits long and four cubits wide. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Join five of the curtains together into one set and the other six into another set. Fold the sixth curtain double at the front of the tent.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Make fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in one set and also along the edge of the end curtain in the other set.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Then make fifty bronze clasps and put them in the loops to fasten the tent together as a unit. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> As for the additional length of the tent curtains, the half curtain that is left over is to hang down at the rear of the tabernacle.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> The tent curtains will be a cubit longer on both sides; what is left will hang over the sides of the tabernacle so as to cover it.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Make for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of hides of sea cows. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> "Make upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Each frame is to be ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide, </verse>
    <verse value="17"> with two projections set parallel to each other. Make all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Make twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle</verse>
    <verse value="19"> and make forty silver bases to go under them--two bases for each frame, one under each projection. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> For the other side, the north side of the tabernacle, make twenty frames</verse>
    <verse value="21"> and forty silver bases--two under each frame. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> Make six frames for the far end, that is, the west end of the tabernacle,</verse>
    <verse value="23"> and make two frames for the corners at the far end.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> At these two corners they must be double from the bottom all the way to the top, and fitted into a single ring; both shall be like that.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> So there will be eight frames and sixteen silver bases--two under each frame.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> "Also make crossbars of acacia wood: five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,</verse>
    <verse value="27"> five for those on the other side, and five for the frames on the west, at the far end of the tabernacle.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> The center crossbar is to extend from end to end at the middle of the frames.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Overlay the frames with gold and make gold rings to hold the crossbars. Also overlay the crossbars with gold.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> "Set up the tabernacle according to the plan shown you on the mountain. </verse>
    <verse value="31"> "Make a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen, with cherubim worked into it by a skilled craftsman. </verse>
    <verse value="32"> Hang it with gold hooks on four posts of acacia wood overlaid with gold and standing on four silver bases. </verse>
    <verse value="33"> Hang the curtain from the clasps and place the ark of the Testimony behind the curtain. The curtain will separate the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place. </verse>
    <verse value="34"> Put the atonement cover on the ark of the Testimony in the Most Holy Place. </verse>
    <verse value="35"> Place the table outside the curtain on the north side of the tabernacle and put the lampstand opposite it on the south side. </verse>
    <verse value="36"> "For the entrance to the tent make a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen--the work of an embroiderer. </verse>
    <verse value="37"> Make gold hooks for this curtain and five posts of acacia wood overlaid with gold. And cast five bronze bases for them.</verse>
