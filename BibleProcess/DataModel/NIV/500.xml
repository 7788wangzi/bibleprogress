    <verse value="1">For the director of music. To [the tune of] "The Doe of the Morning." A psalm of David. My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, so far from the words of my groaning? </verse>
    <verse value="2"> O my God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer, by night, and am not silent.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One; you are the praise of Israel. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> In you our fathers put their trust; they trusted and you delivered them. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> They cried to you and were saved; in you they trusted and were not disappointed.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by men and despised by the people. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> All who see me mock me; they hurl insults, shaking their heads: </verse>
    <verse value="8"> "He trusts in the LORD; let the LORD rescue him. Let him deliver him, since he delights in him."</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Yet you brought me out of the womb; you made me trust in you even at my mother's breast. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> From birth I was cast upon you; from my mother's womb you have been my God. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Many bulls surround me; strong bulls of Bashan encircle me. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> Roaring lions tearing their prey open their mouths wide against me. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. My heart has turned to wax; it has melted away within me. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; you lay me in the dust of death.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Dogs have surrounded me; a band of evil men has encircled me, they have pierced my hands and my feet. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> I can count all my bones; people stare and gloat over me. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> But you, O LORD, be not far off; O my Strength, come quickly to help me. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> Deliver my life from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dogs. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> Rescue me from the mouth of the lions; save me from the horns of the wild oxen.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> I will declare your name to my brothers; in the congregation I will praise you.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> You who fear the LORD, praise him! All you descendants of Jacob, honor him! Revere him, all you descendants of Israel!</verse>
    <verse value="24"> For he has not despised or disdained the suffering of the afflicted one; he has not hidden his face from him but has listened to his cry for help.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> From you comes the theme of my praise in the great assembly; before those who fear you will I fulfill my vows. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> The poor will eat and be satisfied; they who seek the LORD will praise him-- may your hearts live forever! </verse>
    <verse value="27"> All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the LORD, and all the families of the nations will bow down before him, </verse>
    <verse value="28"> for dominion belongs to the LORD and he rules over the nations.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> All the rich of the earth will feast and worship; all who go down to the dust will kneel before him-- those who cannot keep themselves alive. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> Posterity will serve him; future generations will be told about the Lord. </verse>
    <verse value="31"> They will proclaim his righteousness to a people yet unborn-- for he has done it. </verse>
