    <verse value="1">What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don't they come from your desires that battle within you?</verse>
    <verse value="2"> You want something but don't get it. You kill and covet, but you cannot have what you want. You quarrel and fight. You do not have, because you do not ask God. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God? Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Or do you think Scripture says without reason that the spirit he caused to live in us envies intensely? </verse>
    <verse value="6"> But he gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says: "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble." </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> Come near to God and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Grieve, mourn and wail. Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Brothers, do not slander one another. Anyone who speaks against his brother or judges him speaks against the law and judges it. When you judge the law, you are not keeping it, but sitting in judgment on it. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the one who is able to save and destroy. But you--who are you to judge your neighbor? </verse>
    <verse value="13"> Now listen, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money." </verse>
    <verse value="14"> Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Instead, you ought to say, "If it is the Lord's will, we will live and do this or that." </verse>
    <verse value="16"> As it is, you boast and brag. All such boasting is evil. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> Anyone, then, who knows the good he ought to do and doesn't do it, sins. </verse>
