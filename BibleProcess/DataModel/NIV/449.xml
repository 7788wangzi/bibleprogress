    <verse value="1">"My eyes have seen all this, my ears have heard and understood it. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> But I desire to speak to the Almighty and to argue my case with God. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> You, however, smear me with lies; you are worthless physicians, all of you!</verse>
    <verse value="5"> If only you would be altogether silent! For you, that would be wisdom. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Hear now my argument; listen to the plea of my lips. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Will you speak wickedly on God's behalf? Will you speak deceitfully for him?</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Will you show him partiality? Will you argue the case for God? </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Would it turn out well if he examined you? Could you deceive him as you might deceive men? </verse>
    <verse value="10"> He would surely rebuke you if you secretly showed partiality. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Would not his splendor terrify you? Would not the dread of him fall on you? </verse>
    <verse value="12"> Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> "Keep silent and let me speak; then let come to me what may. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> Why do I put myself in jeopardy and take my life in my hands? </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him; I will surely defend my ways to his face. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> Indeed, this will turn out for my deliverance, for no godless man would dare come before him! </verse>
    <verse value="17"> Listen carefully to my words; let your ears take in what I say. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> Now that I have prepared my case, I know I will be vindicated.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Can anyone bring charges against me? If so, I will be silent and die.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> "Only grant me these two things, O God, and then I will not hide from you:</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Withdraw your hand far from me, and stop frightening me with your terrors. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> Then summon me and I will answer, or let me speak, and you reply. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> How many wrongs and sins have I committed? Show me my offense and my sin.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Why do you hide your face and consider me your enemy? </verse>
    <verse value="25"> Will you torment a windblown leaf? Will you chase after dry chaff?</verse>
    <verse value="26"> For you write down bitter things against me and make me inherit the sins of my youth. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> You fasten my feet in shackles; you keep close watch on all my paths by putting marks on the soles of my feet.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> "So man wastes away like something rotten, like a garment eaten by moths.</verse>
