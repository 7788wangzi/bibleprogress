    <verse value="1">Of David. The LORD is my light and my salvation-- whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life-- of whom shall I be afraid? </verse>
    <verse value="2"> When evil men advance against me to devour my flesh, when my enemies and my foes attack me, they will stumble and fall. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Though an army besiege me, my heart will not fear; though war break out against me, even then will I be confident.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> One thing I ask of the LORD, this is what I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD and to seek him in his temple. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> For in the day of trouble he will keep me safe in his dwelling; he will hide me in the shelter of his tabernacle and set me high upon a rock. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Then my head will be exalted above the enemies who surround me; at his tabernacle will I sacrifice with shouts of joy; I will sing and make music to the LORD.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Hear my voice when I call, O LORD; be merciful to me and answer me. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> My heart says of you, "Seek his face!" Your face, LORD, I will seek. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Do not hide your face from me, do not turn your servant away in anger; you have been my helper. Do not reject me or forsake me, O God my Savior. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> Though my father and mother forsake me, the LORD will receive me.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Teach me your way, O LORD; lead me in a straight path because of my oppressors. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> Do not turn me over to the desire of my foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, breathing out violence.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> I am still confident of this: I will see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> Wait for the LORD; be strong and take heart and wait for the LORD. </verse>
