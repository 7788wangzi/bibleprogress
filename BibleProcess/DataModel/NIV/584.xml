    <verse value="1">Praise the LORD. Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures forever.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Who can proclaim the mighty acts of the LORD or fully declare his praise? </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Blessed are they who maintain justice, who constantly do what is right. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Remember me, O LORD, when you show favor to your people, come to my aid when you save them, </verse>
    <verse value="5"> that I may enjoy the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may share in the joy of your nation and join your inheritance in giving praise.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> We have sinned, even as our fathers did; we have done wrong and acted wickedly. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> When our fathers were in Egypt, they gave no thought to your miracles; they did not remember your many kindnesses, and they rebelled by the sea, the Red Sea.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Yet he saved them for his name's sake, to make his mighty power known. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; he led them through the depths as through a desert. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> He saved them from the hand of the foe; from the hand of the enemy he redeemed them. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> Then they believed his promises and sang his praise.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> But they soon forgot what he had done and did not wait for his counsel. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> In the desert they gave in to their craving; in the wasteland they put God to the test. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> So he gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease upon them.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> In the camp they grew envious of Moses and of Aaron, who was consecrated to the LORD. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it buried the company of Abiram. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> Fire blazed among their followers; a flame consumed the wicked.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped an idol cast from metal.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> They exchanged their Glory for an image of a bull, which eats grass. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> They forgot the God who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt,</verse>
    <verse value="22"> miracles in the land of Ham and awesome deeds by the Red Sea. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> So he said he would destroy them-- had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him to keep his wrath from destroying them.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Then they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe his promise. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> They grumbled in their tents and did not obey the LORD. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> So he swore to them with uplifted hand that he would make them fall in the desert, </verse>
    <verse value="27"> make their descendants fall among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> They yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods; </verse>
    <verse value="29"> they provoked the LORD to anger by their wicked deeds, and a plague broke out among them. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> But Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was checked. </verse>
    <verse value="31"> This was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> By the waters of Meribah they angered the LORD, and trouble came to Moses because of them; </verse>
    <verse value="33"> for they rebelled against the Spirit of God, and rash words came from Moses' lips.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> They did not destroy the peoples as the LORD had commanded them, </verse>
    <verse value="35"> but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs. </verse>
    <verse value="36"> They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.</verse>
    <verse value="37"> They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.</verse>
    <verse value="38"> They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was desecrated by their blood. </verse>
    <verse value="39"> They defiled themselves by what they did; by their deeds they prostituted themselves.</verse>
    <verse value="40"> Therefore the LORD was angry with his people and abhorred his inheritance. </verse>
    <verse value="41"> He handed them over to the nations, and their foes ruled over them. </verse>
    <verse value="42"> Their enemies oppressed them and subjected them to their power. </verse>
    <verse value="43"> Many times he delivered them, but they were bent on rebellion and they wasted away in their sin.</verse>
    <verse value="44"> But he took note of their distress when he heard their cry; </verse>
    <verse value="45"> for their sake he remembered his covenant and out of his great love he relented. </verse>
    <verse value="46"> He caused them to be pitied by all who held them captive.</verse>
    <verse value="47"> Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.</verse>
    <verse value="48"> Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say, "Amen!" Praise the LORD.</verse>
