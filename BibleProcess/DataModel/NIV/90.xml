    <verse value="1">Then the LORD said to Moses:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Set up the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, on the first day of the first month. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Place the ark of the Testimony in it and shield the ark with the curtain. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Bring in the table and set out what belongs on it. Then bring in the lampstand and set up its lamps. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Place the gold altar of incense in front of the ark of the Testimony and put the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> "Place the altar of burnt offering in front of the entrance to the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting; </verse>
    <verse value="7"> place the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> Set up the courtyard around it and put the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> "Take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it; consecrate it and all its furnishings, and it will be holy. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> Then anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils; consecrate the altar, and it will be most holy. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Anoint the basin and its stand and consecrate them.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> "Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and wash them with water. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> Then dress Aaron in the sacred garments, anoint him and consecrate him so he may serve me as priest. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> Bring his sons and dress them in tunics. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Anoint them just as you anointed their father, so they may serve me as priests. Their anointing will be to a priesthood that will continue for all generations to come." </verse>
    <verse value="16"> Moses did everything just as the LORD commanded him. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> So the tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month in the second year. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> When Moses set up the tabernacle, he put the bases in place, erected the frames, inserted the crossbars and set up the posts. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering over the tent, as the LORD commanded him. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> He took the Testimony and placed it in the ark, attached the poles to the ark and put the atonement cover over it. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> Then he brought the ark into the tabernacle and hung the shielding curtain and shielded the ark of the Testimony, as the LORD commanded him. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> Moses placed the table in the Tent of Meeting on the north side of the tabernacle outside the curtain </verse>
    <verse value="23"> and set out the bread on it before the LORD, as the LORD commanded him. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> He placed the lampstand in the Tent of Meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle </verse>
    <verse value="25"> and set up the lamps before the LORD, as the LORD commanded him. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> Moses placed the gold altar in the Tent of Meeting in front of the curtain </verse>
    <verse value="27"> and burned fragrant incense on it, as the LORD commanded him. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> Then he put up the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle. </verse>
    <verse value="29"> He set the altar of burnt offering near the entrance to the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, and offered on it burnt offerings and grain offerings, as the LORD commanded him. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> He placed the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing, </verse>
    <verse value="31"> and Moses and Aaron and his sons used it to wash their hands and feet. </verse>
    <verse value="32"> They washed whenever they entered the Tent of Meeting or approached the altar, as the LORD commanded Moses. </verse>
    <verse value="33"> Then Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and altar and put up the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard. And so Moses finished the work. </verse>
    <verse value="34"> Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. </verse>
    <verse value="35"> Moses could not enter the Tent of Meeting because the cloud had settled upon it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. </verse>
    <verse value="36"> In all the travels of the Israelites, whenever the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle, they would set out; </verse>
    <verse value="37"> but if the cloud did not lift, they did not set out--until the day it lifted.</verse>
    <verse value="38"> So the cloud of the LORD was over the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel during all their travels. </verse>
