    <verse value="1">"There is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Iron is taken from the earth, and copper is smelted from ore.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Man puts an end to the darkness; he searches the farthest recesses for ore in the blackest darkness. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Far from where people dwell he cuts a shaft, in places forgotten by the foot of man; far from men he dangles and sways. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> The earth, from which food comes, is transformed below as by fire; </verse>
    <verse value="6"> sapphires come from its rocks, and its dust contains nuggets of gold. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> No bird of prey knows that hidden path, no falcon's eye has seen it.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Proud beasts do not set foot on it, and no lion prowls there. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Man's hand assaults the flinty rock and lays bare the roots of the mountains. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> He tunnels through the rock; his eyes see all its treasures. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> He searches the sources of the rivers and brings hidden things to light.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> "But where can wisdom be found? Where does understanding dwell? </verse>
    <verse value="13"> Man does not comprehend its worth; it cannot be found in the land of the living. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> The deep says, 'It is not in me'; the sea says, 'It is not with me.' </verse>
    <verse value="15"> It cannot be bought with the finest gold, nor can its price be weighed in silver.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir, with precious onyx or sapphires. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> Neither gold nor crystal can compare with it, nor can it be had for jewels of gold. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> Coral and jasper are not worthy of mention; the price of wisdom is beyond rubies. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it; it cannot be bought with pure gold.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> "Where then does wisdom come from? Where does understanding dwell? </verse>
    <verse value="21"> It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing, concealed even from the birds of the air. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> Destruction and Death say, 'Only a rumor of it has reached our ears.' </verse>
    <verse value="23"> God understands the way to it and he alone knows where it dwells,</verse>
    <verse value="24"> for he views the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> When he established the force of the wind and measured out the waters,</verse>
    <verse value="26"> when he made a decree for the rain and a path for the thunderstorm,</verse>
    <verse value="27"> then he looked at wisdom and appraised it; he confirmed it and tested it. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> And he said to man, 'The fear of the Lord--that is wisdom, and to shun evil is understanding.' "</verse>
