    <verse value="1">Of David. Praise be to the LORD my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> He is my loving God and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer, my shield, in whom I take refuge, who subdues peoples under me.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> O LORD, what is man that you care for him, the son of man that you think of him? </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Man is like a breath; his days are like a fleeting shadow.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Part your heavens, O LORD, and come down; touch the mountains, so that they smoke. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Send forth lightning and scatter [the enemies]; shoot your arrows and rout them.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Reach down your hand from on high; deliver me and rescue me from the mighty waters, from the hands of foreigners </verse>
    <verse value="8"> whose mouths are full of lies, whose right hands are deceitful.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> I will sing a new song to you, O God; on the ten-stringed lyre I will make music to you, </verse>
    <verse value="10"> to the One who gives victory to kings, who delivers his servant David from the deadly sword.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Deliver me and rescue me from the hands of foreigners whose mouths are full of lies, whose right hands are deceitful.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Then our sons in their youth will be like well-nurtured plants, and our daughters will be like pillars carved to adorn a palace. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> Our barns will be filled with every kind of provision. Our sheep will increase by thousands, by tens of thousands in our fields; </verse>
    <verse value="14"> our oxen will draw heavy loads. There will be no breaching of walls, no going into captivity, no cry of distress in our streets.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Blessed are the people of whom this is true; blessed are the people whose God is the LORD.</verse>
