    <verse value="1">The Spirit of God came upon Azariah son of Oded. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> He went out to meet Asa and said to him, "Listen to me, Asa and all Judah and Benjamin. The LORD is with you when you are with him. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will forsake you. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> For a long time Israel was without the true God, without a priest to teach and without the law. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> But in their distress they turned to the LORD, the God of Israel, and sought him, and he was found by them. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> In those days it was not safe to travel about, for all the inhabitants of the lands were in great turmoil.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> One nation was being crushed by another and one city by another, because God was troubling them with every kind of distress. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> But as for you, be strong and do not give up, for your work will be rewarded." </verse>
    <verse value="8"> When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Azariah son of Oded the prophet, he took courage. He removed the detestable idols from the whole land of Judah and Benjamin and from the towns he had captured in the hills of Ephraim. He repaired the altar of the LORD that was in front of the portico of the LORD's temple. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Then he assembled all Judah and Benjamin and the people from Ephraim, Manasseh and Simeon who had settled among them, for large numbers had come over to him from Israel when they saw that the LORD his God was with him. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> They assembled at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa's reign. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> At that time they sacrificed to the LORD seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep and goats from the plunder they had brought back. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> They entered into a covenant to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> All who would not seek the LORD, the God of Israel, were to be put to death, whether small or great, man or woman. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> They took an oath to the LORD with loud acclamation, with shouting and with trumpets and horns.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> All Judah rejoiced about the oath because they had sworn it wholeheartedly. They sought God eagerly, and he was found by them. So the LORD gave them rest on every side. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> King Asa also deposed his grandmother Maacah from her position as queen mother, because she had made a repulsive Asherah pole. Asa cut the pole down, broke it up and burned it in the Kidron Valley. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> Although he did not remove the high places from Israel, Asa's heart was fully committed [to the LORD] all his life.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> He brought into the temple of God the silver and gold and the articles that he and his father had dedicated. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> There was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa's reign.</verse>
