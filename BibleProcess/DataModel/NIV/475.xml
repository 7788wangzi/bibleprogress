    <verse value="1">"Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Do you watch when the doe bears her fawn? </verse>
    <verse value="2"> Do you count the months till they bear? Do you know the time they give birth? </verse>
    <verse value="3"> They crouch down and bring forth their young; their labor pains are ended.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Their young thrive and grow strong in the wilds; they leave and do not return.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> "Who let the wild donkey go free? Who untied his ropes? </verse>
    <verse value="6"> I gave him the wasteland as his home, the salt flats as his habitat. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> He laughs at the commotion in the town; he does not hear a driver's shout. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> He ranges the hills for his pasture and searches for any green thing.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> "Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Will he stay by your manger at night? </verse>
    <verse value="10"> Can you hold him to the furrow with a harness? Will he till the valleys behind you? </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Will you rely on him for his great strength? Will you leave your heavy work to him? </verse>
    <verse value="12"> Can you trust him to bring in your grain and gather it to your threshing floor?</verse>
    <verse value="13"> "The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, but they cannot compare with the pinions and feathers of the stork. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> She lays her eggs on the ground and lets them warm in the sand,</verse>
    <verse value="15"> unmindful that a foot may crush them, that some wild animal may trample them. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> She treats her young harshly, as if they were not hers; she cares not that her labor was in vain, </verse>
    <verse value="17"> for God did not endow her with wisdom or give her a share of good sense. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> Yet when she spreads her feathers to run, she laughs at horse and rider.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> "Do you give the horse his strength or clothe his neck with a flowing mane? </verse>
    <verse value="20"> Do you make him leap like a locust, striking terror with his proud snorting? </verse>
    <verse value="21"> He paws fiercely, rejoicing in his strength, and charges into the fray. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> He laughs at fear, afraid of nothing; he does not shy away from the sword. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> The quiver rattles against his side, along with the flashing spear and lance. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> In frenzied excitement he eats up the ground; he cannot stand still when the trumpet sounds. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> At the blast of the trumpet he snorts, 'Aha!' He catches the scent of battle from afar, the shout of commanders and the battle cry.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> "Does the hawk take flight by your wisdom and spread his wings toward the south? </verse>
    <verse value="27"> Does the eagle soar at your command and build his nest on high? </verse>
    <verse value="28"> He dwells on a cliff and stays there at night; a rocky crag is his stronghold. </verse>
    <verse value="29"> From there he seeks out his food; his eyes detect it from afar. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> His young ones feast on blood, and where the slain are, there is he."</verse>
