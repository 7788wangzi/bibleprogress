    <verse value="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Would a wise man answer with empty notions or fill his belly with the hot east wind? </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Would he argue with useless words, with speeches that have no value? </verse>
    <verse value="4"> But you even undermine piety and hinder devotion to God. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Your sin prompts your mouth; you adopt the tongue of the crafty. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Your own mouth condemns you, not mine; your own lips testify against you.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> "Are you the first man ever born? Were you brought forth before the hills?</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Do you listen in on God's council? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?</verse>
    <verse value="9"> What do you know that we do not know? What insights do you have that we do not have?</verse>
    <verse value="10"> The gray-haired and the aged are on our side, men even older than your father. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Are God's consolations not enough for you, words spoken gently to you? </verse>
    <verse value="12"> Why has your heart carried you away, and why do your eyes flash, </verse>
    <verse value="13"> so that you vent your rage against God and pour out such words from your mouth?</verse>
    <verse value="14"> "What is man, that he could be pure, or one born of woman, that he could be righteous? </verse>
    <verse value="15"> If God places no trust in his holy ones, if even the heavens are not pure in his eyes, </verse>
    <verse value="16"> how much less man, who is vile and corrupt, who drinks up evil like water!</verse>
    <verse value="17"> "Listen to me and I will explain to you; let me tell you what I have seen,</verse>
    <verse value="18"> what wise men have declared, hiding nothing received from their fathers</verse>
    <verse value="19"> (to whom alone the land was given when no alien passed among them): </verse>
    <verse value="20"> All his days the wicked man suffers torment, the ruthless through all the years stored up for him. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> Terrifying sounds fill his ears; when all seems well, marauders attack him. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> He despairs of escaping the darkness; he is marked for the sword. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> He wanders about--food for vultures; he knows the day of darkness is at hand. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> Distress and anguish fill him with terror; they overwhelm him, like a king poised to attack, </verse>
    <verse value="25"> because he shakes his fist at God and vaunts himself against the Almighty, </verse>
    <verse value="26"> defiantly charging against him with a thick, strong shield.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> "Though his face is covered with fat and his waist bulges with flesh, </verse>
    <verse value="28"> he will inhabit ruined towns and houses where no one lives, houses crumbling to rubble. </verse>
    <verse value="29"> He will no longer be rich and his wealth will not endure, nor will his possessions spread over the land. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> He will not escape the darkness; a flame will wither his shoots, and the breath of God's mouth will carry him away. </verse>
    <verse value="31"> Let him not deceive himself by trusting what is worthless, for he will get nothing in return. </verse>
    <verse value="32"> Before his time he will be paid in full, and his branches will not flourish. </verse>
    <verse value="33"> He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes, like an olive tree shedding its blossoms. </verse>
    <verse value="34"> For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of those who love bribes. </verse>
    <verse value="35"> They conceive trouble and give birth to evil; their womb fashions deceit." </verse>
