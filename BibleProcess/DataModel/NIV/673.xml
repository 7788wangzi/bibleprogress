    <verse value="1">I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> Like a lily among thorns is my darling among the maidens.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest is my lover among the young men. I delight to sit in his shade, and his fruit is sweet to my taste. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> He has taken me to the banquet hall, and his banner over me is love. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Strengthen me with raisins, refresh me with apples, for I am faint with love. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> His left arm is under my head, and his right arm embraces me. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you by the gazelles and by the does of the field: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Listen! My lover! Look! Here he comes, leaping across the mountains, bounding over the hills. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> My lover is like a gazelle or a young stag. Look! There he stands behind our wall, gazing through the windows, peering through the lattice. </verse>

    <verse value="11"> See! The winter is past; the rains are over and gone.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Flowers appear on the earth; the season of singing has come, the cooing of doves is heard in our land.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> The fig tree forms its early fruit; the blossoming vines spread their fragrance. Arise, come, my darling; my beautiful one, come with me."</verse>
    <verse value="14"> My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hiding places on the mountainside, show me your face, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that ruin the vineyards, our vineyards that are in bloom. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> My lover is mine and I am his; he browses among the lilies. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> Until the day breaks and the shadows flee, turn, my lover, and be like a gazelle or like a young stag on the rugged hills.</verse>
