    <verse value="1">The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming--not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> If it could, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins, </verse>
    <verse value="4"> because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said: "Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me; </verse>
    <verse value="6"> with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Then I said, 'Here I am--it is written about me in the scroll-- I have come to do your will, O God.' " </verse>
    <verse value="8"> First he said, "Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them" (although the law required them to be made). </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Then he said, "Here I am, I have come to do your will." He sets aside the first to establish the second. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> Since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool,</verse>
    <verse value="14"> because by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says: </verse>
    <verse value="16"> "This is the covenant I will make with them after that time, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds." </verse>
    <verse value="17"> Then he adds: "Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more." </verse>
    <verse value="18"> And where these have been forgiven, there is no longer any sacrifice for sin.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, </verse>
    <verse value="20"> by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body, </verse>
    <verse value="21"> and since we have a great priest over the house of God,</verse>
    <verse value="22"> let us draw near to God with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another--and all the more as you see the Day approaching. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, </verse>
    <verse value="27"> but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. </verse>
    <verse value="29"> How much more severely do you think a man deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God under foot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified him, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace?</verse>
    <verse value="30"> For we know him who said, "It is mine to avenge; I will repay," and again, "The Lord will judge his people." </verse>
    <verse value="31"> It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. </verse>
    <verse value="32"> Remember those earlier days after you had received the light, when you stood your ground in a great contest in the face of suffering. </verse>
    <verse value="33"> Sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution; at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> You sympathized with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions. </verse>
    <verse value="35"> So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded. </verse>
    <verse value="36"> You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised. </verse>
    <verse value="37"> For in just a very little while, "He who is coming will come and will not delay. </verse>
    <verse value="38"> But my righteous one will live by faith. And if he shrinks back, I will not be pleased with him." </verse>
    <verse value="39"> But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who believe and are saved.</verse>
