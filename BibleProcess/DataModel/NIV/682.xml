    <verse value="1">See now, the Lord, the LORD Almighty, is about to take from Jerusalem and Judah both supply and support: all supplies of food and all supplies of water, </verse>
    <verse value="2"> the hero and warrior, the judge and prophet, the soothsayer and elder, </verse>
    <verse value="3"> the captain of fifty and man of rank, the counselor, skilled craftsman and clever enchanter.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> I will make boys their officials; mere children will govern them. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> People will oppress each other-- man against man, neighbor against neighbor. The young will rise up against the old, the base against the honorable.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> A man will seize one of his brothers at his father's home, and say, "You have a cloak, you be our leader; take charge of this heap of ruins!"</verse>
    <verse value="7"> But in that day he will cry out, "I have no remedy. I have no food or clothing in my house; do not make me the leader of the people."</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Jerusalem staggers, Judah is falling; their words and deeds are against the LORD, defying his glorious presence. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> The look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Tell the righteous it will be well with them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Woe to the wicked! Disaster is upon them! They will be paid back for what their hands have done.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Youths oppress my people, women rule over them. O my people, your guides lead you astray; they turn you from the path.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> The LORD takes his place in court; he rises to judge the people. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> The LORD enters into judgment against the elders and leaders of his people: "It is you who have ruined my vineyard; the plunder from the poor is in your houses.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> What do you mean by crushing my people and grinding the faces of the poor?" declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> The LORD says, "The women of Zion are haughty, walking along with outstretched necks, flirting with their eyes, tripping along with mincing steps, with ornaments jingling on their ankles. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> Therefore the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the women of Zion; the LORD will make their scalps bald." </verse>
    <verse value="18"> In that day the Lord will snatch away their finery: the bangles and headbands and crescent necklaces, </verse>
    <verse value="19"> the earrings and bracelets and veils, </verse>
    <verse value="20"> the headdresses and ankle chains and sashes, the perfume bottles and charms, </verse>
    <verse value="21"> the signet rings and nose rings, </verse>
    <verse value="22"> the fine robes and the capes and cloaks, the purses </verse>
    <verse value="23"> and mirrors, and the linen garments and tiaras and shawls. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> Instead of fragrance there will be a stench; instead of a sash, a rope; instead of well-dressed hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; instead of beauty, branding. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> Your men will fall by the sword, your warriors in battle. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> The gates of Zion will lament and mourn; destitute, she will sit on the ground. </verse>
