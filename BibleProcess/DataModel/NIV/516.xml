    <verse value="1">A psalm of David. A petition. O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> For your arrows have pierced me, and your hand has come down upon me. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Because of your wrath there is no health in my body; my bones have no soundness because of my sin. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> My guilt has overwhelmed me like a burden too heavy to bear.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> My wounds fester and are loathsome because of my sinful folly. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> I am bowed down and brought very low; all day long I go about mourning. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> My back is filled with searing pain; there is no health in my body. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> I am feeble and utterly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> All my longings lie open before you, O Lord; my sighing is not hidden from you. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> My heart pounds, my strength fails me; even the light has gone from my eyes.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> My friends and companions avoid me because of my wounds; my neighbors stay far away. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> Those who seek my life set their traps, those who would harm me talk of my ruin; all day long they plot deception.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> I am like a deaf man, who cannot hear, like a mute, who cannot open his mouth; </verse>
    <verse value="14"> I have become like a man who does not hear, whose mouth can offer no reply.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> I wait for you, O LORD; you will answer, O Lord my God. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> For I said, "Do not let them gloat or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips."</verse>
    <verse value="17"> For I am about to fall, and my pain is ever with me. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> I confess my iniquity; I am troubled by my sin. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> Many are those who are my vigorous enemies; those who hate me without reason are numerous. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> Those who repay my good with evil slander me when I pursue what is good.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> O LORD, do not forsake me; be not far from me, O my God. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> Come quickly to help me, O Lord my Savior. </verse>
