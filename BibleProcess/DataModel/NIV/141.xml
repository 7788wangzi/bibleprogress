    <verse value="1">Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not resort to sorcery as at other times, but turned his face toward the desert. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> When Balaam looked out and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit of God came upon him </verse>
    <verse value="3"> and he uttered his oracle: "The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of one whose eye sees clearly, </verse>
    <verse value="4"> the oracle of one who hears the words of God, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened:</verse>
    <verse value="5"> "How beautiful are your tents, O Jacob, your dwelling places, O Israel!</verse>
    <verse value="6"> "Like valleys they spread out, like gardens beside a river, like aloes planted by the LORD, like cedars beside the waters. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Water will flow from their buckets; their seed will have abundant water. "Their king will be greater than Agag; their kingdom will be exalted.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> "God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox. They devour hostile nations and break their bones in pieces; with their arrows they pierce them. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Like a lion they crouch and lie down, like a lioness--who dares to rouse them? "May those who bless you be blessed and those who curse you be cursed!"</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Then Balak's anger burned against Balaam. He struck his hands together and said to him, "I summoned you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them these three times. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Now leave at once and go home! I said I would reward you handsomely, but the LORD has kept you from being rewarded." </verse>
    <verse value="12"> Balaam answered Balak, "Did I not tell the messengers you sent me, </verse>
    <verse value="13"> 'Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold, I could not do anything of my own accord, good or bad, to go beyond the command of the LORD--and I must say only what the LORD says'? </verse>
    <verse value="14"> Now I am going back to my people, but come, let me warn you of what this people will do to your people in days to come." </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Then he uttered his oracle: "The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of one whose eye sees clearly,</verse>
    <verse value="16"> the oracle of one who hears the words of God, who has knowledge from the Most High, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened:</verse>
    <verse value="17"> "I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near. A star will come out of Jacob; a scepter will rise out of Israel. He will crush the foreheads of Moab, the skulls of all the sons of Sheth. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> Edom will be conquered; Seir, his enemy, will be conquered, but Israel will grow strong. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> A ruler will come out of Jacob and destroy the survivors of the city." </verse>
    <verse value="20"> Then Balaam saw Amalek and uttered his oracle: "Amalek was first among the nations, but he will come to ruin at last." </verse>
    <verse value="21"> Then he saw the Kenites and uttered his oracle: "Your dwelling place is secure, your nest is set in a rock; </verse>
    <verse value="22"> yet you Kenites will be destroyed when Asshur takes you captive." </verse>
    <verse value="23"> Then he uttered his oracle: "Ah, who can live when God does this? </verse>
    <verse value="24"> Ships will come from the shores of Kittim; they will subdue Asshur and Eber, but they too will come to ruin." </verse>
    <verse value="25"> Then Balaam got up and returned home and Balak went his own way. </verse>
