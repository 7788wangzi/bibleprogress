    <verse value="1">I urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone-- </verse>
    <verse value="2"> for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> This is good, and pleases God our Savior, </verse>
    <verse value="4"> who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, </verse>
    <verse value="6"> who gave himself as a ransom for all men--the testimony given in its proper time. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle--I am telling the truth, I am not lying--and a teacher of the true faith to the Gentiles. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> I want men everywhere to lift up holy hands in prayer, without anger or disputing.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, </verse>
    <verse value="10"> but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> For Adam was formed first, then Eve. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> But women will be saved through childbearing--if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. </verse>
