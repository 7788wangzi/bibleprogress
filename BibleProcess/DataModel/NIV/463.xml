    <verse value="1">And Job continued his discourse:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "As surely as God lives, who has denied me justice, the Almighty, who has made me taste bitterness of soul, </verse>
    <verse value="3"> as long as I have life within me, the breath of God in my nostrils, </verse>
    <verse value="4"> my lips will not speak wickedness, and my tongue will utter no deceit. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> I will never admit you are in the right; till I die, I will not deny my integrity. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> I will maintain my righteousness and never let go of it; my conscience will not reproach me as long as I live.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> "May my enemies be like the wicked, my adversaries like the unjust! </verse>
    <verse value="8"> For what hope has the godless when he is cut off, when God takes away his life? </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Does God listen to his cry when distress comes upon him? </verse>
    <verse value="10"> Will he find delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times?</verse>
    <verse value="11"> "I will teach you about the power of God; the ways of the Almighty I will not conceal. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> You have all seen this yourselves. Why then this meaningless talk?</verse>
    <verse value="13"> "Here is the fate God allots to the wicked, the heritage a ruthless man receives from the Almighty: </verse>
    <verse value="14"> However many his children, their fate is the sword; his offspring will never have enough to eat.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> The plague will bury those who survive him, and their widows will not weep for them. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> Though he heaps up silver like dust and clothes like piles of clay, </verse>
    <verse value="17"> what he lays up the righteous will wear, and the innocent will divide his silver.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> The house he builds is like a moth's cocoon, like a hut made by a watchman. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more; when he opens his eyes, all is gone. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> Terrors overtake him like a flood; a tempest snatches him away in the night. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> The east wind carries him off, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> It hurls itself against him without mercy as he flees headlong from its power. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> It claps its hands in derision and hisses him out of his place.</verse>
