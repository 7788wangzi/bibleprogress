    <verse value="1">A psalm. A song. For the dedication of the temple. Of David. I will exalt you, O LORD, for you lifted me out of the depths and did not let my enemies gloat over me. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> O LORD my God, I called to you for help and you healed me. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> O LORD, you brought me up from the grave; you spared me from going down into the pit.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Sing to the LORD, you saints of his; praise his holy name. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may remain for a night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> When I felt secure, I said, "I will never be shaken." </verse>
    <verse value="7"> O LORD, when you favored me, you made my mountain stand firm; but when you hid your face, I was dismayed.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> To you, O LORD, I called; to the Lord I cried for mercy:</verse>
    <verse value="9"> "What gain is there in my destruction, in my going down into the pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it proclaim your faithfulness?</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Hear, O LORD, and be merciful to me; O LORD, be my help."</verse>
    <verse value="11"> You turned my wailing into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy, </verse>
    <verse value="12"> that my heart may sing to you and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give you thanks forever. </verse>
