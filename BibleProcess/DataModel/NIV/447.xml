    <verse value="1">Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Are all these words to go unanswered? Is this talker to be vindicated? </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Will your idle talk reduce men to silence? Will no one rebuke you when you mock? </verse>
    <verse value="4"> You say to God, 'My beliefs are flawless and I am pure in your sight.' </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Oh, how I wish that God would speak, that he would open his lips against you </verse>
    <verse value="6"> and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom has two sides. Know this: God has even forgotten some of your sin.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> "Can you fathom the mysteries of God? Can you probe the limits of the Almighty? </verse>
    <verse value="8"> They are higher than the heavens--what can you do? They are deeper than the depths of the grave--what can you know? </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> "If he comes along and confines you in prison and convenes a court, who can oppose him? </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Surely he recognizes deceitful men; and when he sees evil, does he not take note? </verse>
    <verse value="12"> But a witless man can no more become wise than a wild donkey's colt can be born a man.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> "Yet if you devote your heart to him and stretch out your hands to him, </verse>
    <verse value="14"> if you put away the sin that is in your hand and allow no evil to dwell in your tent,</verse>
    <verse value="15"> then you will lift up your face without shame; you will stand firm and without fear.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> You will surely forget your trouble, recalling it only as waters gone by. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> Life will be brighter than noonday, and darkness will become like morning. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> You will be secure, because there is hope; you will look about you and take your rest in safety. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> You will lie down, with no one to make you afraid, and many will court your favor. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and escape will elude them; their hope will become a dying gasp." </verse>
