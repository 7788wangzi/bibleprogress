    <verse value="6"> Children's children are a crown to the aged, and parents are the pride of their children.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Arrogant lips are unsuited to a fool-- how much worse lying lips to a ruler!</verse>

    <verse value="23"> A wicked man accepts a bribe in secret to pervert the course of justice.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> A discerning man keeps wisdom in view, but a fool's eyes wander to the ends of the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> A foolish son brings grief to his father and bitterness to the one who bore him.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> It is not good to punish an innocent man, or to flog officials for their integrity.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> A man of knowledge uses words with restraint, and a man of understanding is even-tempered.</verse>
