    <verse value="1">Praise the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, you are very great; you are clothed with splendor and majesty.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> He wraps himself in light as with a garment; he stretches out the heavens like a tent </verse>
    <verse value="3"> and lays the beams of his upper chambers on their waters. He makes the clouds his chariot and rides on the wings of the wind. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> He makes winds his messengers, flames of fire his servants.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> He set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> You covered it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> But at your rebuke the waters fled, at the sound of your thunder they took to flight; </verse>
    <verse value="8"> they flowed over the mountains, they went down into the valleys, to the place you assigned for them. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> You set a boundary they cannot cross; never again will they cover the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> He makes springs pour water into the ravines; it flows between the mountains. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> They give water to all the beasts of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> The birds of the air nest by the waters; they sing among the branches. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the earth is satisfied by the fruit of his work.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> He makes grass grow for the cattle, and plants for man to cultivate-- bringing forth food from the earth: </verse>
    <verse value="15"> wine that gladdens the heart of man, oil to make his face shine, and bread that sustains his heart. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> The trees of the LORD are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> There the birds make their nests; the stork has its home in the pine trees.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> The high mountains belong to the wild goats; the crags are a refuge for the coneys.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> The moon marks off the seasons, and the sun knows when to go down. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> You bring darkness, it becomes night, and all the beasts of the forest prowl. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> The lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> The sun rises, and they steal away; they return and lie down in their dens. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> Then man goes out to his work, to his labor until evening.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> How many are your works, O LORD! In wisdom you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> There is the sea, vast and spacious, teeming with creatures beyond number-- living things both large and small. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> There the ships go to and fro, and the leviathan, which you formed to frolic there.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> These all look to you to give them their food at the proper time. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> When you give it to them, they gather it up; when you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things. </verse>
    <verse value="29"> When you hide your face, they are terrified; when you take away their breath, they die and return to the dust.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> When you send your Spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in his works-- </verse>
    <verse value="32"> he who looks at the earth, and it trembles, who touches the mountains, and they smoke.</verse>
    <verse value="33"> I will sing to the LORD all my life; I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> May my meditation be pleasing to him, as I rejoice in the LORD. </verse>
    <verse value="35"> But may sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked be no more. Praise the LORD, O my soul. Praise the LORD.</verse>
