    <verse value="1">A [shiggaion] of David, which he sang to the LORD concerning Cush, a Benjamite. O LORD my God, I take refuge in you; save and deliver me from all who pursue me, </verse>
    <verse value="2"> or they will tear me like a lion and rip me to pieces with no one to rescue me.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> O LORD my God, if I have done this and there is guilt on my hands-- </verse>
    <verse value="4"> if I have done evil to him who is at peace with me or without cause have robbed my foe-- </verse>
    <verse value="5"> then let my enemy pursue and overtake me; let him trample my life to the ground and make me sleep in the dust. [Selah]</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Arise, O LORD, in your anger; rise up against the rage of my enemies. Awake, my God; decree justice. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Let the assembled peoples gather around you. Rule over them from on high;</verse>
    <verse value="8"> let the LORD judge the peoples. Judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, according to my integrity, O Most High. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> O righteous God, who searches minds and hearts, bring to an end the violence of the wicked and make the righteous secure.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> My shield is God Most High, who saves the upright in heart. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> God is a righteous judge, a God who expresses his wrath every day. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> If he does not relent, he will sharpen his sword; he will bend and string his bow. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> He has prepared his deadly weapons; he makes ready his flaming arrows.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> He who is pregnant with evil and conceives trouble gives birth to disillusionment. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> He who digs a hole and scoops it out falls into the pit he has made. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> The trouble he causes recoils on himself; his violence comes down on his own head.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> I will give thanks to the LORD because of his righteousness and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High. </verse>
