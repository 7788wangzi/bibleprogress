    <verse value="1">As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, </verse>
    <verse value="2"> in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, </verse>
    <verse value="5"> made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions--it is by grace you have been saved. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, </verse>
    <verse value="7"> in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God-- </verse>
    <verse value="9"> not by works, so that no one can boast. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called "uncircumcised" by those who call themselves "the circumcision" (that done in the body by the hands of men)-- </verse>
    <verse value="12"> remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> For he himself is our peace, who has made the two one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility, </verse>
    <verse value="15"> by abolishing in his flesh the law with its commandments and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new man out of the two, thus making peace, </verse>
    <verse value="16"> and in this one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens with God's people and members of God's household, </verse>
    <verse value="20"> built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit. </verse>
