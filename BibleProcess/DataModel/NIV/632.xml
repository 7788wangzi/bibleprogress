    <verse value="1">Listen, my sons, to a father's instruction; pay attention and gain understanding. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> I give you sound learning, so do not forsake my teaching.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> When I was a boy in my father's house, still tender, and an only child of my mother,</verse>
    <verse value="4"> he taught me and said, "Lay hold of my words with all your heart; keep my commands and you will live.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget my words or swerve from them. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you; love her, and she will watch over you. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Wisdom is supreme; therefore get wisdom. Though it cost all you have, get understanding. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> Esteem her, and she will exalt you; embrace her, and she will honor you. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> She will set a garland of grace on your head and present you with a crown of splendor."</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Listen, my son, accept what I say, and the years of your life will be many. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> I guide you in the way of wisdom and lead you along straight paths. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> When you walk, your steps will not be hampered; when you run, you will not stumble.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Hold on to instruction, do not let it go; guard it well, for it is your life. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of evil men. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Avoid it, do not travel on it; turn from it and go on your way.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> For they cannot sleep till they do evil; they are robbed of slumber till they make someone fall. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> They eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> The path of the righteous is like the first gleam of dawn, shining ever brighter till the full light of day. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know what makes them stumble.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> My son, pay attention to what I say; listen closely to my words. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart;</verse>
    <verse value="22"> for they are life to those who find them and health to a man's whole body. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> Put away perversity from your mouth; keep corrupt talk far from your lips.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Let your eyes look straight ahead, fix your gaze directly before you. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> Make level paths for your feet and take only ways that are firm. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> Do not swerve to the right or the left; keep your foot from evil.</verse>
