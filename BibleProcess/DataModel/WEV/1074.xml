    <verse value="1">Now concerning spiritual things, brothers, I don't want you to be ignorant.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> You know that when you were heathen {or Gentiles}, you were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God's Spirit says, "Jesus is accursed." No one can say, "Jesus is Lord," but by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> There are various kinds of workings, but the same God, who works all things in all.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;</verse>
    <verse value="9"> to another faith, by the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, by the same Spirit;</verse>
    <verse value="10"> and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; to another different kinds of languages; and to another the interpretation of languages.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> But the one and the same Spirit works all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all given to drink into one Spirit.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> For the body is not one member, but many.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> If the foot would say, "Because I'm not the hand, I'm not part of the body," it is not therefore not part of the body.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> If the ear would say, "Because I'm not the eye, I'm not part of the body," it's not therefore not part of the body.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?</verse>
    <verse value="18"> But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> If they were all one member, where would the body be?</verse>
    <verse value="20"> But now they are many members, but one body.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> The eye can't tell the hand, "I have no need for you," or again the head to the feet, "I have no need for you."</verse>
    <verse value="22"> No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety;</verse>
    <verse value="24"> whereas our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honor to the inferior part,</verse>
    <verse value="25"> that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. Or when one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> God has set some in the assembly: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers?</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret?</verse>
    <verse value="31"> But earnestly desire the best gifts. Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you. |</verse>
