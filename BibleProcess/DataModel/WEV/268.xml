    <verse value="1">It happened after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had stayed two days in Ziklag;</verse>
    <verse value="2"> it happened on the third day, that behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn, and earth on his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and showed respect.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> David said to him, "Where do you come from?" | He said to him, "I have escaped out of the camp of Israel."</verse>
    <verse value="4"> David said to him, "How did it go? Please tell me." | He answered, "The people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen and are dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also." |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> David said to the young man who told him, "How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?" |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> The young man who told him said, "As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and behold, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, 'Here I am.'</verse>
    <verse value="8"> He said to me, 'Who are you?' I answered him, 'I am an Amalekite.'</verse>
    <verse value="9"> He said to me, 'Please stand beside me, and kill me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.'</verse>
    <verse value="10"> So I stood beside him, and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he had fallen. I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord." |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them; and likewise all the men who were with him.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> They mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Yahweh, {"Yahweh" is God's proper Name, sometimes rendered "LORD" (all caps) in other translations.} and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> David said to the young man who told him, "Where are you from?" | He answered, "I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite." |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> David said to him, "How were you not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy Yahweh's anointed?"</verse>
    <verse value="15"> David called one of the young men, and said, "Go near, and fall on him." He struck him, so that he died.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> David said to him, "Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, 'I have slain Yahweh's anointed.'" |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son</verse>
    <verse value="18"> (and he commanded them to teach the children of Judah the song of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar): |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> "Your glory, Israel, is slain on your high places! / How the mighty have fallen! |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Don't tell it in Gath. / Don't publish it in the streets of Ashkelon, | lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, / lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> You mountains of Gilboa, / let there be no dew nor rain on you, neither fields of offerings; / For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, / The shield of Saul was not anointed with oil. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> From the blood of the slain, / from the fat of the mighty, / Jonathan's bow didn't turn back. / Saul's sword didn't return empty. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives. / In their death, they were not divided. | They were swifter than eagles. / They were stronger than lions. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, / who clothed you in scarlet delicately, / who put ornaments of gold on your clothing. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! / Jonathan is slain on your high places. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan. / You have been very pleasant to me. / Your love to me was wonderful, / passing the love of women. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> How are the mighty fallen, / and the weapons of war perished!" |</verse>
