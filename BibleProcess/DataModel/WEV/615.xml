    <verse value="1">By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down. / Yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> On the willows in its midst, / we hung up our harps. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For there, those who led us captive asked us for songs. / Those who tormented us demanded songs of joy: / "Sing us one of the songs of Zion!" |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> How can we sing Yahweh's song in a foreign land? |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> If I forget you, Jerusalem, / let my right hand forget its skill. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I don't remember you; / if I don't prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Remember, Yahweh, against the children of Edom, / the day of Jerusalem; / who said, "Raze it! / Raze it even to its foundation!" |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, / he will be happy who rewards you, / as you have served us. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Happy shall he be, / who takes and dashes your little ones against the rock. |</verse>
