    <verse value="1">God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> The fear of you and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the sky. Everything that the ground teems with, and all the fish of the sea are delivered into your hand.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Every moving thing that lives will be food for you. As the green herb, I have given everything to you.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> But flesh with its life, its blood, you shall not eat.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> I will surely require your blood of your lives. At the hand of every animal I will require it. At the hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother, I will require the life of man.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Whoever sheds man's blood, his blood will be shed by man, for God made man in his own image.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Be fruitful and multiply. Increase abundantly in the earth, and multiply in it." |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying,</verse>
    <verse value="9"> "As for me, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your offspring after you,</verse>
    <verse value="10"> and with every living creature that is with you: the birds, the livestock, and every animal of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ship, even every animal of the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> I will establish my covenant with you: all flesh will not be cut off any more by the waters of the flood, neither will there ever again be a flood to destroy the earth."</verse>
    <verse value="12"> God said, "This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:</verse>
    <verse value="13"> I set my rainbow in the cloud, and it will be for a sign of a covenant between me and the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> It will happen, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud,</verse>
    <verse value="15"> and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> The rainbow will be in the cloud. I will look at it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth."</verse>
    <verse value="17"> God said to Noah, "This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth." |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> The sons of Noah who went out from the ship were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham is the father of Canaan.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> These three were the sons of Noah, and from these, the whole earth was populated. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Noah began to be a farmer, and planted a vineyard.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> He drank of the wine and got drunk. He was uncovered within his tent.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders, went in backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were backwards, and they didn't see their father's nakedness.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done to him.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> He said, | "Canaan is cursed. / He will be servant of servants to his brothers." |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> He said, | "Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Shem. / Let Canaan be his servant. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> May God enlarge Japheth. / Let him dwell in the tents of Shem. / Let Canaan be his servant." |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Noah lived three hundred fifty years after the flood.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> All the days of Noah were nine hundred fifty years, then he died. |</verse>
