    <verse value="1">For the Chief Musician. By David, the servant of Yahweh. | An oracle is within my heart about the disobedience of the wicked: / "There is no fear of God before his eyes." |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> For he flatters himself in his own eyes, / too much to detect and hate his sin. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit. / He has ceased to be wise and to do good. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> He plots iniquity on his bed. / He sets himself in a way that is not good. / He doesn't abhor evil. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Your loving kindness, Yahweh, is in the heavens. / Your faithfulness reaches to the skies. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Your righteousness is like the mountains of God. / Your judgments are like a great deep. / Yahweh, you preserve man and animal. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> How precious is your loving kindness, God! / The children of men take refuge under the shadow of your wings. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> They shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your house. / You will make them drink of the river of your pleasures. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> For with you is the spring of life. / In your light shall we see light. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Oh continue your loving kindness to those who know you, / your righteousness to the upright in heart. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Don't let the foot of pride come against me. / Don't let the hand of the wicked drive me away. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> There the workers of iniquity are fallen. / They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise. |</verse>
