    <verse value="1">For the Chief Musician. By David the servant of Yahweh, who spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. He said, | I love you, Yahweh, my strength. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer; / my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; / my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> I call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised; / and I am saved from my enemies. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> The cords of death surrounded me. / The floods of ungodliness made me afraid. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> The cords of Sheol {Sheol is the place of the dead.} were around me. / The snares of death came on me. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> In my distress I called on Yahweh, / and cried to my God. | He heard my voice out of his temple. / My cry before him came into his ears. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Then the earth shook and trembled. / The foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken, / because he was angry. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Smoke went out of his nostrils. / Consuming fire came out of his mouth. / Coals were kindled by it. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> He bowed the heavens also, and came down. / Thick darkness was under his feet. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> He rode on a cherub, and flew. / Yes, he soared on the wings of the wind. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> He made darkness his hiding place, his pavilion around him, / darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed, / hailstones and coals of fire. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Yahweh also thundered in the sky. / The Most High uttered his voice: / hailstones and coals of fire. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> He sent out his arrows, and scattered them; / Yes, great lightning bolts, and routed them. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Then the channels of waters appeared. / The foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, Yahweh, / at the blast of the breath of your nostrils. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> He sent from on high. / He took me. / He drew me out of many waters. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> He delivered me from my strong enemy, / from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> They came on me in the day of my calamity, / but Yahweh was my support. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> He brought me forth also into a large place. / He delivered me, because he delighted in me. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness. / According to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, / and have not wickedly departed from my God. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> For all his ordinances were before me. / I didn't put away his statutes from me. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> I was also blameless with him. / I kept myself from my iniquity. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness, / according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> With the merciful you will show yourself merciful. / With the perfect man, you will show yourself perfect. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> With the pure, you will show yourself pure. / With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> For you will save the afflicted people, / but the haughty eyes you will bring down. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> For you will light my lamp, Yahweh. / My God will light up my darkness. |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> For by you, I advance through a troop. / By my God, I leap over a wall. |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> As for God, his way is perfect. / The word of Yahweh is tried. / He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him. |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> For who is God, except Yahweh? / Who is a rock, besides our God, /</verse>
    <verse value="32"> the God who arms me with strength, and makes my way perfect? |</verse>
    <verse value="33"> He makes my feet like deer's feet, / and sets me on my high places. |</verse>
    <verse value="34"> He teaches my hands to war, / so that my arms bend a bow of bronze. |</verse>
    <verse value="35"> You have also given me the shield of your salvation. / Your right hand sustains me. / Your gentleness has made me great. |</verse>
    <verse value="36"> You have enlarged my steps under me, / My feet have not slipped. |</verse>
    <verse value="37"> I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them. / Neither will I turn again until they are consumed. |</verse>
    <verse value="38"> I will strike them through, so that they will not be able to rise. / They shall fall under my feet. |</verse>
    <verse value="39"> For you have armed me with strength to the battle. / You have subdued under me those who rose up against me. |</verse>
    <verse value="40"> You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, / that I might cut off those who hate me. |</verse>
    <verse value="41"> They cried, but there was none to save; / even to Yahweh, but he didn't answer them. |</verse>
    <verse value="42"> Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind. / I cast them out as the mire of the streets. |</verse>
    <verse value="43"> You have delivered me from the strivings of the people. / You have made me the head of the nations. | A people whom I have not known shall serve me. /</verse>
    <verse value="44"> As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me. / The foreigners shall submit themselves to me. |</verse>
    <verse value="45"> The foreigners shall fade away, / and shall come trembling out of their close places. |</verse>
    <verse value="46"> Yahweh lives; and blessed be my rock. / Exalted be the God of my salvation, |</verse>
    <verse value="47"> even the God who executes vengeance for me, / and subdues peoples under me. |</verse>
    <verse value="48"> He rescues me from my enemies. / Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me. / You deliver me from the violent man. |</verse>
    <verse value="49"> Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations, / and will sing praises to your name. |</verse>
    <verse value="50"> He gives great deliverance to his king, / and shows loving kindness to his anointed, / to David and to his seed, forevermore. |</verse>
