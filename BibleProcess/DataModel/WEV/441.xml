    <verse value="1">"Call now; is there any who will answer you? / To which of the holy ones will you turn? |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> For resentment kills the foolish man, / and jealousy kills the simple. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> I have seen the foolish taking root, / but suddenly I cursed his habitation. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> His children are far from safety. / They are crushed in the gate. / Neither is there any to deliver them, |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> whose harvest the hungry eats up, / and take it even out of the thorns. / The snare gapes for their substance. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> For affliction doesn't come forth from the dust, / neither does trouble spring out of the ground; |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> but man is born to trouble, / as the sparks fly upward. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> "But as for me, I would seek God. / I would commit my cause to God, |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> who does great things that can't be fathomed, / marvelous things without number; |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> who gives rain on the earth, / and sends waters on the fields; |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> so that he sets up on high those who are low, / those who mourn are exalted to safety. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> He frustrates the devices of the crafty, / So that their hands can't perform their enterprise. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> He takes the wise in their own craftiness; / the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> They meet with darkness in the day time, / and grope at noonday as in the night. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> But he saves from the sword of their mouth, / even the needy from the hand of the mighty. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> So the poor has hope, / and injustice shuts her mouth. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> "Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects. / Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> For he wounds, and binds up. / He injures, and his hands make whole. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> He will deliver you in six troubles; / yes, in seven no evil shall touch you. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> In famine he will redeem you from death; / in war, from the power of the sword. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, / neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> At destruction and famine you shall laugh, / neither shall you be afraid of the animals of the earth. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> For you shall be allied with the stones of the field. / The animals of the field shall be at peace with you. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> You shall know that your tent is in peace. / You shall visit your fold, and shall miss nothing. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> You shall know also that your seed shall be great, / Your offspring as the grass of the earth. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> You shall come to your grave in a full age, / like a shock of grain comes in its season. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Look this, we have searched it, so it is. / Hear it, and know it for your good." |</verse>
