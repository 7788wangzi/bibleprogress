    <verse value="1">He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray, and not give up,</verse>
    <verse value="2"> saying, "There was a judge in a certain city who didn't fear God, and didn't respect man.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> A widow was in that city, and she often came to him, saying, 'Defend me from my adversary!'</verse>
    <verse value="4"> He wouldn't for a while, but afterward he said to himself, 'Though I neither fear God, nor respect man,</verse>
    <verse value="5"> yet because this widow bothers me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual coming.'" |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> The Lord said, "Listen to what the unrighteous judge says.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Won't God avenge his chosen ones, who are crying out to him day and night, and yet he exercises patience with them?</verse>
    <verse value="8"> I tell you that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?" |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> He spoke also this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised all others.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> "Two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> The Pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this: 'God, I thank you, that I am not like the rest of men, extortioners, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get.'</verse>
    <verse value="13"> But the tax collector, standing far away, wouldn't even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner!'</verse>
    <verse value="14"> I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted." |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> They were also bringing their babies to him, that he might touch them. But when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Jesus summoned them, saying, "Allow the little children to come to me, and don't hinder them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Most certainly, I tell you, whoever doesn't receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, he will in no way enter into it." |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> A certain ruler asked him, saying, "Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Jesus asked him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good, except one--God.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> You know the commandments: 'Don't commit adultery,' 'Don't murder,' 'Don't steal,' 'Don't give false testimony,' 'Honor your father and your mother.'" {Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20} |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> He said, "I have observed all these things from my youth up." |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> When Jesus heard these things, he said to him, "You still lack one thing. Sell all that you have, and distribute it to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Come, follow me." |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was very rich. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Jesus, seeing that he became very sad, said, "How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!</verse>
    <verse value="25"> For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God." |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Those who heard it said, "Then who can be saved?" |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> But he said, "The things which are impossible with men are possible with God." |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Peter said, "Look, we have left everything, and followed you." |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> He said to them, "Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the Kingdom of God's sake,</verse>
    <verse value="30"> who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the world to come, eternal life." |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> He took the twelve aside, and said to them, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> For he will be delivered up to the Gentiles, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on.</verse>
    <verse value="33"> They will scourge and kill him. On the third day, he will rise again." |</verse>
    <verse value="34"> They understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they didn't understand the things that were said.</verse>
    <verse value="35"> It happened, as he came near Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road, begging.</verse>
    <verse value="36"> Hearing a multitude going by, he asked what this meant.</verse>
    <verse value="37"> They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.</verse>
    <verse value="38"> He cried out, "Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!"</verse>
    <verse value="39"> Those who led the way rebuked him, that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, "You son of David, have mercy on me!" |</verse>
    <verse value="40"> Standing still, Jesus commanded him to be brought to him. When he had come near, he asked him,</verse>
    <verse value="41"> "What do you want me to do?" | He said, "Lord, that I may see again." |</verse>
    <verse value="42"> Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you." |</verse>
    <verse value="43"> Immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God. All the people, when they saw it, praised God. |</verse>
