    <verse value="1">"Comfort, comfort my people," says your God.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Speak comfortably to Jerusalem; and call out to her that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she has received of Yahweh's hand double for all her sins." |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> The voice of one who calls out, / "Prepare the way of Yahweh in the wilderness! / Make a level highway in the desert for our God. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Every valley shall be exalted, / and every mountain and hill shall be made low. / The uneven shall be made level, / and the rough places a plain. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> The glory of Yahweh shall be revealed, / and all flesh shall see it together; / for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it."</verse>
    <verse value="6"> The voice of one saying, "Cry!" / One said, "What shall I cry?" | "All flesh is like grass, / and all its glory is like the flower of the field. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> The grass withers, / the flower fades, / because Yahweh's breath blows on it. / Surely the people are like grass. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> The grass withers, / the flower fades; / but the word of our God stands forever." |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> You who tell good news to Zion, go up on a high mountain. / You who tell good news to Jerusalem, lift up your voice with strength. / Lift it up. Don't be afraid. / Say to the cities of Judah, "Behold, your God!" |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Behold, the Lord Yahweh will come as a mighty one, / and his arm will rule for him. / Behold, his reward is with him, / and his recompense before him. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> He will feed his flock like a shepherd. / He will gather the lambs in his arm, / and carry them in his bosom. / He will gently lead those who have their young. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, / and marked off the sky with his span, / and calculated the dust of the earth in a measure, / and weighed the mountains in scales, / and the hills in a balance? |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Who has directed the Spirit of Yahweh, / or has taught him as his counselor? |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Who did he take counsel with, / and who instructed him, / and taught him in the path of justice, / and taught him knowledge, / and showed him the way of understanding? |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Behold, the nations are like a drop in a bucket, / and are regarded as a speck of dust on a balance. / Behold, he lifts up the islands like a very little thing. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, / nor its animals sufficient for a burnt offering. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> All the nations are like nothing before him. / They are regarded by him as less than nothing, and vanity. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> To whom then will you liken God? / Or what likeness will you compare to him? |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> A workman has cast an image, / and the goldsmith overlays it with gold, / and casts silver chains for it. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> He who is too impoverished for such an offering chooses a tree that will not rot. / He seeks a skillful workman to set up an engraved image for him that will not be moved. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Haven't you known? / Haven't you heard, yet? / Haven't you been told from the beginning? / Haven't you understood from the foundations of the earth? |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, / and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; / who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, / and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in; /</verse>
    <verse value="23"> who brings princes to nothing; / who makes the judges of the earth like meaningless. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> They are planted scarcely. / They are sown scarcely. / Their stock has scarcely taken root in the ground. / He merely blows on them, and they wither, / and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> "To whom then will you liken me? / Who is my equal?" says the Holy One. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Lift up your eyes on high, / and see who has created these, / who brings out their army by number. / He calls them all by name. / by the greatness of his might, / and because he is strong in power, / Not one is lacking. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Why do you say, Jacob, / and speak, Israel, / "My way is hidden from Yahweh, / and the justice due me is disregarded by my God?" |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Haven't you known? / Haven't you heard? / The everlasting God, Yahweh, / The Creator of the ends of the earth, doesn't faint. / He isn't weary. / His understanding is unsearchable. |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> He gives power to the weak. / He increases the strength of him who has no might. |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Even the youths faint and get weary, / and the young men utterly fall; /</verse>
    <verse value="31"> But those who wait for Yahweh will renew their strength. / They will mount up with wings like eagles. / They will run, and not be weary. / They will walk, and not faint. |</verse>
