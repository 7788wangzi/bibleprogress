    <verse value="1">Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Do you think this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?</verse>
    <verse value="5"> But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God;</verse>
    <verse value="6"> who "will pay back to everyone according to their works:" {Psalm 62:12; Proverbs 24:12}</verse>
    <verse value="7"> to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility, eternal life;</verse>
    <verse value="8"> but to those who are self-seeking, and don't obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath and indignation,</verse>
    <verse value="9"> oppression and anguish, on every soul of man who works evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> But glory, honor, and peace go to every man who works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> For there is no partiality with God.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law. As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> For it isn't the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified</verse>
    <verse value="14"> (for when Gentiles who don't have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves,</verse>
    <verse value="15"> in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them)</verse>
    <verse value="16"> in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Good News, by Jesus Christ. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Indeed you bear the name of a Jew, and rest on the law, and glory in God,</verse>
    <verse value="18"> and know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,</verse>
    <verse value="19"> and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,</verse>
    <verse value="20"> a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> You therefore who teach another, don't you teach yourself? You who preach that a man shouldn't steal, do you steal?</verse>
    <verse value="22"> You who say a man shouldn't commit adultery. Do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</verse>
    <verse value="23"> You who glory in the law, through your disobedience of the law do you dishonor God?</verse>
    <verse value="24"> For "the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you," {Isaiah 52:5; Ezekiel 36:22} just as it is written.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> For circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won't his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Won't the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law?</verse>
    <verse value="28"> For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh;</verse>
    <verse value="29"> but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God. |</verse>
