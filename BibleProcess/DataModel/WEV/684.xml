    <verse value="1">Let me sing for my well beloved a song of my beloved about his vineyard. / My beloved had a vineyard on a very fruitful hill. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> He dug it up, / gathered out its stones, / planted it with the choicest vine, / built a tower in its midst, / and also cut out a winepress therein. | He looked for it to yield grapes, / but it yielded wild grapes. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> "Now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, / please judge between me and my vineyard. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? / Why, when I looked for it to yield grapes, did it yield wild grapes? |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard. / I will take away its hedge, and it will be eaten up. / I will break down its wall of it, and it will be trampled down. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> I will lay it a wasteland. / It won't be pruned nor hoed, / but it will grow briers and thorns. / I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it." |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> For the vineyard of Yahweh of Armies is the house of Israel, / and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: / and he looked for justice, but, behold, oppression; / for righteousness, but, behold, a cry of distress. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Woe to those who join house to house, / who lay field to field, until there is no room, / and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land! |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> In my ears, Yahweh of Armies says: "Surely many houses will be desolate, / even great and beautiful, unoccupied. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> For ten acres {literally, ten yokes, or the amount of land that ten yokes of oxen can plow in one day, which is about 10 acres or 4 hectares.} of vineyard shall yield one bath, {1 bath is about 22 litres or 5.8 U. S. gallons} / and a homer {1 homer is about 220 litres or 6 bushels} of seed shall yield an ephah. {1 ephah is about 22 litres or 0.6 bushels or about 2 pecks)--only one tenth of what was sown.}" |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Woe to those who rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; / who stay late into the night, until wine inflames them! |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> The harp, lyre, tambourine, and flute, with wine, are at their feasts; / but they don't respect the work of Yahweh, / neither have they considered the operation of his hands. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Therefore my people go into captivity for lack of knowledge. / Their honorable men are famished, / and their multitudes are parched with thirst. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Therefore Sheol {Sheol is the place of the dead.} has enlarged its desire, / and opened its mouth without measure; / and their glory, their multitude, their pomp, and he who rejoices among them, descend into it. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> So man is brought low, / mankind is humbled, / and the eyes of the arrogant ones are humbled; |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> but Yahweh of Armies is exalted in justice, / and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture, / and strangers will eat the ruins of the rich. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, / and wickedness as with cart rope; |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Who say, "Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it; / and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, / that we may know it!" |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; / who put darkness for light, / and light for darkness; | who put bitter for sweet, / and sweet for bitter! |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, / and prudent in their own sight! |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine, / and champions at mixing strong drink; |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> who acquit the guilty for a bribe, / but deny justice for the innocent! |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, / and as the dry grass sinks down in the flame, / so their root shall be as rottenness, / and their blossom shall go up as dust; | because they have rejected the law of Yahweh of Armies, / and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Therefore Yahweh's anger burns against his people, / and he has stretched out his hand against them, and has struck them. | The mountains tremble, / and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets. | For all this, his anger is not turned away, / but his hand is still stretched out. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> He will lift up a banner to the nations from far, / and he will whistle for them from the end of the earth. / Behold, they will come speedily and swiftly. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> None shall be weary nor stumble among them; / none shall slumber nor sleep; / neither shall the belt of their waist be untied, / nor the latchet of their shoes be broken: |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> whose arrows are sharp, / and all their bows bent. | Their horses' hoofs will be like flint, / and their wheels like a whirlwind. |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Their roaring will be like a lioness. / They will roar like young lions. | Yes, they shall roar, / and seize their prey and carry it off, / and there will be no one to deliver. |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> They will roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea. / If one looks to the land behold, darkness and distress. / The light is darkened in its clouds. |</verse>
