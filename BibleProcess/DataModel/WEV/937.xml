    <verse value="1">When he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Behold, a leper came to him and worshiped him, saying, "Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean." |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Jesus stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, "I want to. Be made clean." Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Jesus said to him, "See that you tell nobody, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> When he came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him,</verse>
    <verse value="6"> and saying, "Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented." |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him." |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> The centurion answered, "Lord, I'm not worthy for you to come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and tell another, 'Come,' and he comes; and tell my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it." |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who followed, "Most certainly I tell you, I haven't found so great a faith, not even in Israel.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven,</verse>
    <verse value="12"> but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Jesus said to the centurion, "Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed." His servant was healed in that hour. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother lying sick with a fever.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> He touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and served him. {TR reads "them" instead of "him"}</verse>
    <verse value="16"> When evening came, they brought to him many possessed with demons. He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick;</verse>
    <verse value="17"> that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: "He took our infirmities, and bore our diseases." {Isaiah 53:4}</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Now when Jesus saw great multitudes around him, he gave the order to depart to the other side. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> A scribe came, and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go." |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head." |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Another of his disciples said to him, "Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father." |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead." |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> When he got into a boat, his disciples followed him.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Behold, a violent storm came up on the sea, so much that the boat was covered with the waves, but he was asleep.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> They came to him, and woke him up, saying, "Save us, Lord! We are dying!" |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> He said to them, "Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?" Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> The men marveled, saying, "What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?" |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> When he came to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes, {NU reads "Gadarenes"} two people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Behold, they cried out, saying, "What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?"</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> The demons begged him, saying, "If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs." |</verse>
    <verse value="32"> He said to them, "Go!" | They came out, and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water.</verse>
    <verse value="33"> Those who fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with demons.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> Behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders. |</verse>
