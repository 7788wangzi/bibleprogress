    <verse value="1">After these things the word of Yahweh came to Abram in a vision, saying, "Don't be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward." |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Abram said, "Lord {The word translated "Lord" is "Adonai."} Yahweh, what will you give me, since I go childless, and he who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?"</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Abram said, "Behold, to me you have given no seed: and, behold, one born in my house is my heir." |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Behold, the word of Yahweh came to him, saying, "This man will not be your heir, but he who will come out of your own body will be your heir."</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Yahweh brought him outside, and said, "Look now toward the sky, and count the stars, if you are able to count them." He said to Abram, "So shall your seed be."</verse>
    <verse value="6"> He believed in Yahweh; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> He said to him, "I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it." |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> He said, "Lord Yahweh, how will I know that I will inherit it?" |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> He said to him, "Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon."</verse>
    <verse value="10"> He brought him all of these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each half opposite the other; but he didn't divide the birds.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> The birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram drove them away. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. Now terror and great darkness fell on him.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> He said to Abram, "Know for sure that your seed will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them. They will afflict them four hundred years.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> I will also judge that nation, whom they will serve. Afterward they will come out with great wealth,</verse>
    <verse value="15"> but you will go to your fathers in peace. You will be buried in a good old age.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> In the fourth generation they will come here again, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full."</verse>
    <verse value="17"> It came to pass that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> In that day Yahweh made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:</verse>
    <verse value="19"> the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,</verse>
    <verse value="20"> the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,</verse>
    <verse value="21"> the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites." |</verse>
