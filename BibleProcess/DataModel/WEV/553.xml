    <verse value="1">For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Do Not Destroy." A Psalm by Asaph. A song. | We give thanks to you, God. / We give thanks, for your Name is near. / Men tell about your wondrous works. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> When I choose the appointed time, / I will judge blamelessly. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> The earth and all its inhabitants quake. / I firmly hold its pillars. | Selah. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> I said to the arrogant, "Don't boast!" / I said to the wicked, "Don't lift up the horn. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Don't lift up your horn on high. / Don't speak with a stiff neck." |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> For neither from the east, nor from the west, / nor yet from the south, comes exaltation. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> But God is the judge. / He puts down one, and lifts up another. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> For in the hand of Yahweh there is a cup, / full of foaming wine mixed with spices. | He pours it out. / Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> But I will declare this forever: / I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> I will cut off all the horns of the wicked, / but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up. |</verse>
