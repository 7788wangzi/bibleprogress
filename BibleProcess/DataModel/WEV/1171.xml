    <verse value="1">After these things I looked and saw a door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard, like a trumpet speaking with me, was one saying, "Come up here, and I will show you the things which must happen after this." |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Immediately I was in the Spirit. Behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne</verse>
    <verse value="3"> that looked like a jasper stone and a sardius. There was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald to look at.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Around the throne were twenty-four thrones. On the thrones were twenty-four elders sitting, dressed in white garments, with crowns of gold on their heads.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Out of the throne proceed lightnings, sounds, and thunders. There were seven lamps of fire burning before his throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Before the throne was something like a sea of glass, similar to crystal. In the midst of the throne, and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> The first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face like a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> The four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within. They have no rest day and night, saying, "Holy, holy, holy {Hodges/Farstad MT reads "holy" 9 times instead of 3.} is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come!" |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> When the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to him who sits on the throne, to him who lives forever and ever,</verse>
    <verse value="10"> the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives forever and ever, and throw their crowns before the throne, saying,</verse>
    <verse value="11"> "Worthy are you, our Lord and God, the Holy One, {TR omits "and God, the Holy One,"} to receive the glory, the honor, and the power, for you created all things, and because of your desire they existed, and were created!" |</verse>
