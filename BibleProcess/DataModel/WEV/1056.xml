    <verse value="1">Brothers, my heart's desire and my prayer to God is for Israel, that they may be saved.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they didn't subject themselves to the righteousness of God.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> For Christ is the fulfillment {or, completion, or end} of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> For Moses writes about the righteousness of the law, "The one who does them will live by them." {Leviticus 18:5}</verse>
    <verse value="6"> But the righteousness which is of faith says this, "Don't say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?' {Deuteronomy 30:12} (that is, to bring Christ down);</verse>
    <verse value="7"> or, 'Who will descend into the abyss?' {Deuteronomy 30:13} (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)"</verse>
    <verse value="8"> But what does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth, and in your heart"; {Deuteronomy 30:14} that is, the word of faith, which we preach:</verse>
    <verse value="9"> that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> For with the heart, one believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> For the Scripture says, "Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed." {Isaiah 28:16} |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich to all who call on him.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> For, "Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved." {Joel 2:32}</verse>
    <verse value="14"> How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in him whom they have not heard? How will they hear without a preacher?</verse>
    <verse value="15"> And how will they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: | "How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the Good News of peace, / who bring glad tidings of good things!" {Isaiah 52:7} |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> But they didn't all listen to the glad news. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our report?" {Isaiah 53:1}</verse>
    <verse value="17"> So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> But I say, didn't they hear? Yes, most certainly, | "Their sound went out into all the earth, / their words to the ends of the world." {Psalm 19:4} |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> But I ask, didn't Israel know? First Moses says, | "I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, / with a nation void of understanding I will make you angry." {Deuteronomy 32:31} |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Isaiah is very bold, and says, | "I was found by those who didn't seek me. / I was revealed to those who didn't ask for me." {Isaiah 65:1} |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> But as to Israel he says, "All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people." {Isaiah 65:2} |</verse>
