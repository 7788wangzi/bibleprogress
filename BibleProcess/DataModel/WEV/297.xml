    <verse value="1">It happened in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> The house which king Solomon built for Yahweh, its length was sixty cubits, and its breadth twenty, and its height thirty cubits.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> The porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was its length, according to the breadth of the house. Ten cubits was its breadth before the house.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> For the house he made windows of fixed lattice work.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Against the wall of the house he built stories all around, against the walls of the house all around, both of the temple and of the oracle; and he made side rooms all around.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> The nethermost story was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for on the outside he made offsets in the wall of the house all around, that the beams should not have hold in the walls of the house.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> The house, when it was in building, was built of stone prepared at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> The door for the middle side rooms was in the right side of the house: and they went up by winding stairs into the middle story, and out of the middle into the third.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> He built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> The word of Yahweh came to Solomon, saying,</verse>
    <verse value="12"> "Concerning this house which you are building, if you will walk in my statutes, and execute my ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I establish my word with you, which I spoke to David your father.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel." |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> So Solomon built the house, and finished it.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> He built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar: from the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> He built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the ceiling: he built them for it within, for an oracle, even for the most holy place.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> In front of the temple sanctuary was forty cubits.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> There was cedar on the house within, carved with buds and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> He prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Within the oracle was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in its height; and he overlaid it with pure gold: and he covered the altar with cedar.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> The whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house was finished: also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> In the oracle he made two cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing to the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> The other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one form.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> He set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> He overlaid the cherubim with gold.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> He carved all the walls of the house around with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, inside and outside.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> The floor of the house he overlaid with gold, inside and outside.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> For the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive wood: the lintel and door posts were a fifth part of the wall.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> So he made two doors of olive wood; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold on the cherubim, and on the palm trees.</verse>
    <verse value="33"> So also made he for the entrance of the temple door posts of olive wood, out of a fourth part of the wall;</verse>
    <verse value="34"> and two doors of fir wood: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.</verse>
    <verse value="35"> He carved cherubim and palm trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted on the engraved work.</verse>
    <verse value="36"> He built the inner court with three courses of cut stone, and a course of cedar beams.</verse>
    <verse value="37"> In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of Yahweh laid, in the month Ziv.</verse>
    <verse value="38"> In the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all its parts, and according to all its fashion. So was he seven years in building it. |</verse>
