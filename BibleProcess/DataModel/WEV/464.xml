    <verse value="1">"Surely there is a mine for silver, / and a place for gold which they refine. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Iron is taken out of the earth, / and copper is smelted out of the ore. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Man sets an end to darkness, / and searches out, to the furthest bound, / the stones of obscurity and of thick darkness. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> He breaks open a shaft away from where people live. / They are forgotten by the foot. / They hang far from men, they swing back and forth. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> As for the earth, out of it comes bread; / Underneath it is turned up as it were by fire. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Sapphires come from its rocks. / It has dust of gold. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> That path no bird of prey knows, / neither has the falcon's eye seen it. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> The proud animals have not trodden it, / nor has the fierce lion passed by there. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> He puts forth his hand on the flinty rock, / and he overturns the mountains by the roots. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> He cuts out channels among the rocks. / His eye sees every precious thing. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> He binds the streams that they don't trickle. / The thing that is hidden he brings forth to light. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> "But where shall wisdom be found? / Where is the place of understanding? |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Man doesn't know its price; / Neither is it found in the land of the living. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> The deep says, 'It isn't in me.' / The sea says, 'It isn't with me.' |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> It can't be gotten for gold, / neither shall silver be weighed for its price. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> It can't be valued with the gold of Ophir, / with the precious onyx, or the sapphire {or, lapis lazuli}. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Gold and glass can't equal it, / neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal. / Yes, the price of wisdom is above rubies. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, / Neither shall it be valued with pure gold. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Where then does wisdom come from? / Where is the place of understanding? |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Seeing it is hidden from the eyes of all living, / and kept close from the birds of the sky. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Destruction and Death say, / 'We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.' |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> "God understands its way, / and he knows its place. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> For he looks to the ends of the earth, / and sees under the whole sky. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> He establishes the force of the wind. / Yes, he measures out the waters by measure. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> When he made a decree for the rain, / and a way for the lightning of the thunder; |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> then he saw it, and declared it. / He established it, yes, and searched it out. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> To man he said, / 'Behold, the fear of the Lord {The word translated "Lord" is "Adonai."}, that is wisdom. / To depart from evil is understanding.'" |</verse>
