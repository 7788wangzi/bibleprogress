    <verse value="1">Then Job answered, |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "How long will you torment me, / and crush me with words? |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> You have reproached me ten times. / You aren't ashamed that you attack me. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> If it is true that I have erred, / my error remains with myself. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> If indeed you will magnify yourselves against me, / and plead against me my reproach; |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> know now that God has subverted me, / and has surrounded me with his net. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> "Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard. / I cry for help, but there is no justice. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> He has walled up my way so that I can't pass, / and has set darkness in my paths. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> He has stripped me of my glory, / and taken the crown from my head. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone. / My hope he has plucked up like a tree. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> He has also kindled his wrath against me. / He counts me among his adversaries. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> His troops come on together, / build a siege ramp against me, / and encamp around my tent. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> "He has put my brothers far from me. / My acquaintances are wholly estranged from me. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> My relatives have gone away. / My familiar friends have forgotten me. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Those who dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger. / I am an alien in their sight. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> I call to my servant, and he gives me no answer. / I beg him with my mouth. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> My breath is offensive to my wife. / I am loathsome to the children of my own mother. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Even young children despise me. / If I arise, they speak against me. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> All my familiar friends abhor me. / They whom I loved have turned against me. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> My bones stick to my skin and to my flesh. / I have escaped by the skin of my teeth. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> "Have pity on me, have pity on me, you my friends; / for the hand of God has touched me. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Why do you persecute me as God, / and are not satisfied with my flesh? |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> "Oh that my words were now written! / Oh that they were inscribed in a book! |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> That with an iron pen and lead / they were engraved in the rock forever! |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives. / In the end, he will stand upon the earth. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> After my skin is destroyed, / then in my flesh shall I see God, |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Whom I, even I, shall see on my side. / My eyes shall see, and not as a stranger. | "My heart is consumed within me. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> If you say, 'How we will persecute him!' / because the root of the matter is found in me, |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> be afraid of the sword, / for wrath brings the punishments of the sword, / that you may know there is a judgment." |</verse>
