    <verse value="1">"Yes, at this my heart trembles, / and is moved out of its place. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice, / the sound that goes out of his mouth. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> He sends it forth under the whole sky, / and his lightning to the ends of the earth. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> After it a voice roars. / He thunders with the voice of his majesty. / He doesn't hold back anything when his voice is heard. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> God thunders marvelously with his voice. / He does great things, which we can't comprehend. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> For he says to the snow, 'Fall on the earth;' / likewise to the shower of rain, / and to the showers of his mighty rain. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> He seals up the hand of every man, / that all men whom he has made may know it. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Then the animals take cover, / and remain in their dens. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Out of its room comes the storm, / and cold out of the north. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> By the breath of God, ice is given, / and the breadth of the waters is frozen. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Yes, he loads the thick cloud with moisture. / He spreads abroad the cloud of his lightning. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> It is turned around by his guidance, / that they may do whatever he commands them / on the surface of the habitable world, |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Whether it is for correction, or for his land, / or for loving kindness, that he causes it to come. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> "Listen to this, Job. / Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Do you know how God controls them, / and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine? |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Do you know the workings of the clouds, / the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge? |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> You whose clothing is warm, / when the earth is still by reason of the south wind? |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Can you, with him, spread out the sky, / which is strong as a cast metal mirror? |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Teach us what we shall tell him, / for we can't make our case by reason of darkness. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Shall it be told him that I would speak? / Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up? |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Now men don't see the light which is bright in the skies, / but the wind passes, and clears them. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Out of the north comes golden splendor. / With God is awesome majesty. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> We can't reach the Almighty. / He is exalted in power. / In justice and great righteousness, he will not oppress. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Therefore men revere him. / He doesn't regard any who are wise of heart." |</verse>
