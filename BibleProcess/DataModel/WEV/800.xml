    <verse value="1">I am the man that has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness, and not in light. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Surely against me he turns his hand again and again all the day. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> My flesh and my skin has he made old; he has broken my bones. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> He has built against me, and surrounded me with gall and travail. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> He has made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> He has walled me about, that I can't go forth; he has made my chain heavy. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Yes, when I cry, and call for help, he shuts out my prayer. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> He has walled up my ways with cut stone; he has made my paths crooked. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> He is to me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> He has turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; he has made me desolate. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my kidneys. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> I am become a derision to all my people, and their song all the day.  |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> He has filled me with bitterness, he has sated me with wormwood. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> He has also broken my teeth with gravel stones; he has covered me with ashes. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> You have removed my soul far off from peace; I forgot prosperity. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> I said, My strength is perished, and my expectation from Yahweh. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Remember my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> My soul still remembers them, and is bowed down within me. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> This I recall to my mind; therefore have I hope. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> It is because of Yahweh's loving kindnesses that we are not consumed, because his compassion doesn't fail. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Yahweh is my portion, says my soul; therefore will I hope in him. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Yahweh is good to those who wait for him, to the soul that seeks him. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Yahweh. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he has laid it on him. |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Let him put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope. |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him; let him be filled full with reproach. |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> For the Lord will not cast off forever. |</verse>
    <verse value="32"> For though he cause grief, yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses. |</verse>
    <verse value="33"> For he does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men. |</verse>
    <verse value="34"> To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth, |</verse>
    <verse value="35"> To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High, |</verse>
    <verse value="36"> To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord doesn't approve. |</verse>
    <verse value="37"> Who is he who says, and it comes to pass, when the Lord doesn't command it? |</verse>
    <verse value="38"> Doesn't evil and good come out of the mouth of the Most High? |</verse>
    <verse value="39"> Why does a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? |</verse>
    <verse value="40"> Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Yahweh. |</verse>
    <verse value="41"> Let us lift up our heart with our hands to God {The Hebrew word rendered "God" is "Elohim."} in the heavens. |</verse>
    <verse value="42"> We have transgressed and have rebelled; you have not pardoned. |</verse>
    <verse value="43"> You have covered with anger and pursued us; you have killed, you have not pitied. |</verse>
    <verse value="44"> You have covered yourself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through. |</verse>
    <verse value="45"> You have made us an off-scouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples. |</verse>
    <verse value="46"> All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us. |</verse>
    <verse value="47"> Fear and the pit have come on us, devastation and destruction. |</verse>
    <verse value="48"> My eye runs down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people. |</verse>
    <verse value="49"> My eye pours down, and doesn't cease, without any intermission, |</verse>
    <verse value="50"> Until Yahweh look down, and see from heaven. |</verse>
    <verse value="51"> My eye affects my soul, because of all the daughters of my city. |</verse>
    <verse value="52"> They have chased me relentlessly like a bird, those who are my enemies without cause. |</verse>
    <verse value="53"> They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone on me. |</verse>
    <verse value="54"> Waters flowed over my head; I said, I am cut off. |</verse>
    <verse value="55"> I called on your name, Yahweh, out of the lowest dungeon. |</verse>
    <verse value="56"> You heard my voice; don't hide your ear at my breathing, at my cry. |</verse>
    <verse value="57"> You drew near in the day that I called on you; you said, Don't be afraid. |</verse>
    <verse value="58"> Lord, you have pleaded the causes of my soul; you have redeemed my life. |</verse>
    <verse value="59"> Yahweh, you have seen my wrong. Judge my cause. |</verse>
    <verse value="60"> You have seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me. |</verse>
    <verse value="61"> You have heard their reproach, Yahweh, and all their devices against me, |</verse>
    <verse value="62"> The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day. |</verse>
    <verse value="63"> You see their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song. |</verse>
    <verse value="64"> You will render to them a recompense, Yahweh, according to the work of their hands. |</verse>
    <verse value="65"> You will give them hardness of heart, your curse to them. |</verse>
    <verse value="66"> You will pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of Yahweh. |</verse>
