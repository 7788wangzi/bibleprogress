    <verse value="1">The wicked flee when no one pursues; / but the righteous are as bold as a lion. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> In rebellion, a land has many rulers, / but order is maintained by a man of understanding and knowledge. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> A needy man who oppresses the poor / is like a driving rain which leaves no crops. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Those who forsake the law praise the wicked; / but those who keep the law contend with them. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Evil men don't understand justice; / but those who seek Yahweh understand it fully. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Better is the poor who walks in his integrity, / than he who is perverse in his ways, and he is rich. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Whoever keeps the law is a wise son; / but he who is a companion of gluttons shames his father. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> He who increases his wealth by excessive interest / gathers it for one who has pity on the poor. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> He who turns away his ear from hearing the law, / even his prayer is an abomination. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way, / he will fall into his own trap; / but the blameless will inherit good. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> The rich man is wise in his own eyes; / but the poor who has understanding sees through him. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> When the righteous triumph, there is great glory; / but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> He who conceals his sins doesn't prosper, / but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Blessed is the man who always fears; / but one who hardens his heart falls into trouble. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> As a roaring lion or a charging bear, / so is a wicked ruler over helpless people. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> A tyrannical ruler lacks judgment. / One who hates ill-gotten gain will have long days. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> A man who is tormented by life blood will be a fugitive until death; / no one will support him. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Whoever walks blamelessly is kept safe; / but one with perverse ways will fall suddenly. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> One who works his land will have an abundance of food; / but one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> A faithful man is rich with blessings; / but one who is eager to be rich will not go unpunished. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> To show partiality is not good; / yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> A stingy man hurries after riches, / and doesn't know that poverty waits for him. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> One who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor / than one who flatters with the tongue. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Whoever robs his father or his mother, and says, "It's not wrong." / He is a partner with a destroyer. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> One who is greedy stirs up strife; / but one who trusts in Yahweh will prosper. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> One who trusts in himself is a fool; / but one who walks in wisdom is kept safe. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> One who gives to the poor has no lack; / but one who closes his eyes will have many curses. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> When the wicked rise, men hide themselves; / but when they perish, the righteous thrive. |</verse>
