    <verse value="1">For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "The Lilies of the Covenant." A Psalm by Asaph. | Hear us, Shepherd of Israel, / you who lead Joseph like a flock, / you who sit above the cherubim, shine forth. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might! / Come to save us! |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Turn us again, God. / Cause your face to shine, / and we will be saved. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Yahweh God of Armies, / How long will you be angry against the prayer of your people? |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> You have fed them with the bread of tears, / and given them tears to drink in large measure. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> You make us a source of contention to our neighbors. / Our enemies laugh among themselves. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Turn us again, God of Armies. / Cause your face to shine, / and we will be saved. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> You brought a vine out of Egypt. / You drove out the nations, and planted it. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> You cleared the ground for it. / It took deep root, and filled the land. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> The mountains were covered with its shadow. / Its boughs were like God's cedars. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> It sent out its branches to the sea, / Its shoots to the River. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Why have you broken down its walls, / so that all those who pass by the way pluck it? |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> The boar out of the wood ravages it. / The wild animals of the field feed on it. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Turn again, we beg you, God of Armies. / Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vine, |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> the stock which your right hand planted, / the branch that you made strong for yourself. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> It's burned with fire. / It's cut down. / They perish at your rebuke. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, / on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> So we will not turn away from you. / Revive us, and we will call on your name. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Turn us again, Yahweh God of Armies. / Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved. |</verse>
