    <verse value="1">Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling fragrance.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be mentioned among you, as becomes saints;</verse>
    <verse value="4"> nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not appropriate; but rather giving of thanks. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Know this for sure, that no sexually immoral person, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Let no one deceive you with empty words. For because of these things, the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Therefore don't be partakers with them.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,</verse>
    <verse value="9"> for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,</verse>
    <verse value="10"> proving what is well pleasing to the Lord.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> For the things which are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> But all things, when they are reproved, are revealed by the light, for everything that reveals is light.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Therefore he says, "Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you." |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Therefore watch carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise;</verse>
    <verse value="16"> redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Therefore don't be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Don't be drunken with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,</verse>
    <verse value="19"> speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing, and making melody in your heart to the Lord;</verse>
    <verse value="20"> giving thanks always concerning all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father;</verse>
    <verse value="21"> subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is the head of the assembly, being himself the savior of the body.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> But as the assembly is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the assembly, and gave himself up for it;</verse>
    <verse value="26"> that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,</verse>
    <verse value="27"> that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord also does the assembly;</verse>
    <verse value="30"> because we are members of his body, of his flesh and bones.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> "For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will be joined to his wife. The two will become one flesh." {Genesis 2:24}</verse>
    <verse value="32"> This mystery is great, but I speak concerning Christ and of the assembly.</verse>
    <verse value="33"> Nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she respects her husband. |</verse>
