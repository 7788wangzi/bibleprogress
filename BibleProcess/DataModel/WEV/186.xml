    <verse value="2"> He said, | "Yahweh came from Sinai, / And rose from Seir to them. | He shone forth from Mount Paran. / He came from the ten thousands of holy ones. / At his right hand was a fiery law for them. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Yes, he loves the people. / All his saints are in your hand. / They sat down at your feet; / each receives your words. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Moses commanded us a law, / An inheritance for the assembly of Jacob. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> He was king in Jeshurun, / When the heads of the people were gathered, / All the tribes of Israel together. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> "Let Reuben live, and not die; / Nor let his men be few." |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> This is for Judah. He said, | "Hear, Yahweh, the voice of Judah. / Bring him in to his people. | With his hands he contended for himself. / You shall be a help against his adversaries." |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Of Levi he said, | "Your Thummim and your Urim are with your godly one, / whom you proved at Massah, / with whom you strove at the waters of Meribah; |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> who said of his father, and of his mother, 'I have not seen him;' / Neither did he acknowledge his brothers, / Nor did he know his own children: | For they have observed your word, / and keep your covenant. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> They shall teach Jacob your ordinances, / and Israel your law. | They shall put incense before you, / and whole burnt offering on your altar. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Yahweh, bless his substance. / Accept the work of his hands. | Strike through the hips of those who rise up against him, / of those who hate him, that they not rise again." |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Of Benjamin he said, | "The beloved of Yahweh shall dwell in safety by him. / He covers him all the day long. / He dwells between his shoulders." |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Of Joseph he said, | "His land is blessed by Yahweh, / for the precious things of the heavens, for the dew, / for the deep that couches beneath, |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, / for the precious things of the growth of the moons, |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> for the chief things of the ancient mountains, / for the precious things of the everlasting hills, |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> for the precious things of the earth and its fullness, / the good will of him who lived in the bush {i. e. the burning bush of Exodus 3:3-4.}. | Let this come on the head of Joseph, / on the crown of the head of him who was separate from his brothers. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> The firstborn of his herd, majesty is his. / His horns are the horns of the wild ox. / With them he shall push all of the peoples, to the ends of the earth: | They are the ten thousands of Ephraim. / They are the thousands of Manasseh." |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Of Zebulun he said, | "Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out; / and Issachar, in your tents. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> They shall call the peoples to the mountain. / There they will offer sacrifices of righteousness, | for they shall draw out the abundance of the seas, / the hidden treasures of the sand." |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Of Gad he said, | "He who enlarges Gad is blessed. / He dwells as a lioness, / and tears the arm, yes, the crown of the head. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> He provided the first part for himself, / for there was the lawgiver's portion reserved. | He came with the heads of the people. / He executed the righteousness of Yahweh, / His ordinances with Israel." |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Of Dan he said, | "Dan is a lion's cub / that leaps out of Bashan." |</verse>

    <verse value="24"> Of Asher he said, | "Asher is blessed with children. / Let him be acceptable to his brothers. / Let him dip his foot in oil. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Your bars shall be iron and brass. / As your days, so your strength will be. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> "There is none like God, Jeshurun, / who rides on the heavens for your help, / In his excellency on the skies. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> The eternal God is your dwelling place. / Underneath are the everlasting arms. | He thrust out the enemy from before you, / and said, 'Destroy!' |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Israel dwells in safety; / the fountain of Jacob alone, | In a land of grain and new wine. / Yes, his heavens drop down dew. |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> You are happy, Israel. / Who is like you, a people saved by Yahweh, / the shield of your help, / the sword of your excellency! | Your enemies shall submit themselves to you. / You shall tread on their high places." |</verse>
