    <verse value="1">A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed and pours out his complaint before Yahweh. | Hear my prayer, Yahweh! / Let my cry come to you. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Don't hide your face from me in the day of my distress. / Turn your ear to me. / Answer me quickly in the day when I call. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For my days consume away like smoke. / My bones are burned as a torch. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> My heart is blighted like grass, and withered, / for I forget to eat my bread. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> By reason of the voice of my groaning, / my bones stick to my skin. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> I am like a pelican of the wilderness. / I have become as an owl of the waste places. /</verse>
    <verse value="7"> I watch, and have become like a sparrow that is alone on the housetop. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> My enemies reproach me all day. / Those who are mad at me use my name as a curse. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> For I have eaten ashes like bread, / and mixed my drink with tears, |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Because of your indignation and your wrath, / for you have taken me up, and thrown me away. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> My days are like a long shadow. / I have withered like grass. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> But you, Yahweh, will remain forever; / your renown endures to all generations. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> You will arise and have mercy on Zion; / for it is time to have pity on her. / Yes, the set time has come. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> For your servants take pleasure in her stones, / and have pity on her dust. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> So the nations will fear the name of Yahweh; / all the kings of the earth your glory. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> For Yahweh has built up Zion. / He has appeared in his glory. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> He has responded to the prayer of the destitute, / and has not despised their prayer. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> This will be written for the generation to come. / A people which will be created will praise Yah. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary. / From heaven, Yahweh saw the earth; |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> to hear the groans of the prisoner; / to free those who are condemned to death; |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> that men may declare the name of Yahweh in Zion, / and his praise in Jerusalem; |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> when the peoples are gathered together, / the kingdoms, to serve Yahweh. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> He weakened my strength along the course. / He shortened my days. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> I said, "My God, don't take me away in the midst of my days. / Your years are throughout all generations. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Of old, you laid the foundation of the earth. / The heavens are the work of your hands. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> They will perish, but you will endure. / Yes, all of them will wear out like a garment. / You will change them like a cloak, and they will be changed. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> But you are the same. / Your years will have no end. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> The children of your servants will continue. / Their seed will be established before you." |</verse>
