    <verse value="20"> All the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> They came, everyone whose heart stirred him up, and everyone whom his spirit made willing, and brought Yahweh's offering, for the work of the Tent of Meeting, and for all of its service, and for the holy garments.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> They came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted, and brought brooches, earrings, signet rings, and armlets, all jewels of gold; even every man who offered an offering of gold to Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Everyone, with whom was found blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goats' hair, rams' skins dyed red, and sea cow hides, brought them.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Everyone who offered an offering of silver and brass brought Yahweh's offering; and everyone, with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service, brought it.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> All the women who were wise-hearted spun with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, the blue, the purple, the scarlet, and the fine linen.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> All the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats' hair.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> The rulers brought the onyx stones, and the stones to be set, for the ephod and for the breastplate;</verse>
    <verse value="28"> and the spice, and the oil for the light, for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> The children of Israel brought a freewill offering to Yahweh; every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work, which Yahweh had commanded to be made by Moses. |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Moses said to the children of Israel, "Behold, Yahweh has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> He has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all kinds of workmanship;</verse>
    <verse value="32"> and to make skillful works, to work in gold, in silver, in brass,</verse>
    <verse value="33"> in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all kinds of skillful workmanship.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> He has put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.</verse>
    <verse value="35"> He has filled them with wisdom of heart, to work all kinds of workmanship, of the engraver, of the skillful workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of those who do any workmanship, and of those who make skillful works. |</verse>
