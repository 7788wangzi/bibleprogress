    <verse value="1">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Command the children of Israel, and tell them, 'My offering, my food for my offerings made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to me, you shall observe to offer to me in their due season.'</verse>
    <verse value="3"> You shall tell them, 'This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer to Yahweh: male lambs a year old without blemish, two day by day, for a continual burnt offering.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> You shall offer the one lamb in the morning, and you shall offer the other lamb at evening;</verse>
    <verse value="5"> with the tenth part of an ephah {1 ephah is about 22 litres or about 2/3 of a bushel} of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in Mount Sinai for a pleasant aroma, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Its drink offering shall be the fourth part of a hin for the one lamb. You shall pour out a drink offering of strong drink to Yahweh in the holy place.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> The other lamb you shall offer at evening: as the meal offering of the morning, and as the drink offering of it, you shall offer it, an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> "'On the Sabbath day two male lambs a year old without blemish, and two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with oil, and the drink offering of it:</verse>
    <verse value="10"> this is the burnt offering of every Sabbath, besides the continual burnt offering, and the drink offering of it. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> "'In the beginnings of your months you shall offer a burnt offering to Yahweh: two young bulls, and one ram, seven male lambs a year old without blemish;</verse>
    <verse value="12"> and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with oil, for each bull; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with oil, for the one ram;</verse>
    <verse value="13"> and a tenth part of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal offering to every lamb; for a burnt offering of a pleasant aroma, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull, and the third part of a hin for the ram, and the fourth part of a hin for a lamb: this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> One male goat for a sin offering to Yahweh; it shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering, and the drink offering of it. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> "'In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is Yahweh's Passover.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> On the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> In the first day shall be a holy convocation: you shall do no servile work;</verse>
    <verse value="19"> but you shall offer an offering made by fire, a burnt offering to Yahweh: two young bulls, and one ram, and seven male lambs a year old; they shall be to you without blemish;</verse>
    <verse value="20"> and their meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil: you shall offer three tenth parts for a bull, and two tenth parts for the ram.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> You shall offer a tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs;</verse>
    <verse value="22"> and one male goat for a sin offering, to make atonement for you.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> You shall offer these besides the burnt offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> In this way you shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh: it shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering, and the drink offering of it.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> On the seventh day you shall have a holy convocation: you shall do no servile work. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> "'Also in the day of the first fruits, when you offer a new meal offering to Yahweh in your feast of weeks, you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no servile work;</verse>
    <verse value="27"> but you shall offer a burnt offering for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh: two young bulls, one ram, seven male lambs a year old;</verse>
    <verse value="28"> and their meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil, three tenth parts for each bull, two tenth parts for the one ram,</verse>
    <verse value="29"> a tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs;</verse>
    <verse value="30"> one male goat, to make atonement for you.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> Besides the continual burnt offering, and the meal offering of it, you shall offer them (they shall be to you without blemish), and their drink offerings. |</verse>
