    <verse value="1">My son, keep my words. / Lay up my commandments within you. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Keep my commandments and live! / Guard my teaching as the apple of your eye. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Bind them on your fingers. / Write them on the tablet of your heart. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Tell wisdom, "You are my sister." / Call understanding your relative, |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> that they may keep you from the strange woman, / from the foreigner who flatters with her words. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> For at the window of my house, / I looked out through my lattice. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> I saw among the simple ones. / I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding, |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> passing through the street near her corner, / he went the way to her house, |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> in the twilight, in the evening of the day, / in the middle of the night and in the darkness. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute, / and with crafty intent. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> She is loud and defiant. / Her feet don't stay in her house. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Now she is in the streets, now in the squares, / and lurking at every corner. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> So she caught him, and kissed him. / With an impudent face she said to him: |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> "Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me. / This day I have paid my vows. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Therefore I came out to meet you, / to diligently seek your face, / and I have found you. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, / with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Come, let's take our fill of loving until the morning. / Let's solace ourselves with loving. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> For my husband isn't at home. / He has gone on a long journey. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> He has taken a bag of money with him. / He will come home at the full moon." |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> With persuasive words, she led him astray. / With the flattering of her lips, she seduced him. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> He followed her immediately, / as an ox goes to the slaughter, / as a fool stepping into a noose. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Until an arrow strikes through his liver, / as a bird hurries to the snare, / and doesn't know that it will cost his life. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Now therefore, sons, listen to me. / Pay attention to the words of my mouth. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Don't let your heart turn to her ways. / Don't go astray in her paths, |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> for she has thrown down many wounded. / Yes, all her slain are a mighty army. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Her house is the way to Sheol {Sheol is the place of the dead.}, / going down to the rooms of death. |</verse>
