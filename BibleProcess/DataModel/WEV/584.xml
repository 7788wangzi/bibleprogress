    <verse value="1">Praise Yahweh! / Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, / for his loving kindness endures forever. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Who can utter the mighty acts of Yahweh, / or fully declare all his praise? |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Blessed are those who keep justice. / Blessed is one who does what is right at all times. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Remember me, Yahweh, with the favor that you show to your people. / Visit me with your salvation, |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> that I may see the prosperity of your chosen, / that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, / that I may glory with your inheritance. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> We have sinned with our fathers. / We have committed iniquity. / We have done wickedly. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Our fathers didn't understand your wonders in Egypt. / They didn't remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses, / but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea {or, Sea of Reeds}. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, / that he might make his mighty power known. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> He rebuked the Red Sea {or, Sea of Reeds} also, and it was dried up; / so he led them through the depths, as through a desert. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> He saved them from the hand of him who hated them, / and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> The waters covered their adversaries. / There was not one of them left. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Then they believed his words. / They sang his praise. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> They soon forgot his works. / They didn't wait for his counsel, /</verse>
    <verse value="14"> but gave in to craving in the desert, / and tested God in the wasteland. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> He gave them their request, / but sent leanness into their soul. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> They envied Moses also in the camp, / and Aaron, Yahweh's saint. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, / and covered the company of Abiram. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> A fire was kindled in their company. / The flame burned up the wicked. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> They made a calf in Horeb, / and worshiped a molten image. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Thus they exchanged their glory / for an image of a bull that eats grass. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> They forgot God, their Savior, / who had done great things in Egypt, /</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Wondrous works in the land of Ham, / and awesome things by the Red Sea {or, Sea of Reeds}. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Therefore he said that he would destroy them, / had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach, / to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn't destroy them. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Yes, they despised the pleasant land. / They didn't believe his word, /</verse>
    <verse value="25"> but murmured in their tents, / and didn't listen to Yahweh's voice. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Therefore he swore to them / that he would overthrow them in the wilderness, /</verse>
    <verse value="27"> that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, / and scatter them in the lands. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> They joined themselves also to Baal Peor, / and ate the sacrifices of the dead. |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds. / The plague broke in on them. |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Then Phinehas stood up, and executed judgment, / so the plague was stopped. |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> That was credited to him for righteousness, / for all generations to come. |</verse>
    <verse value="32"> They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, / so that Moses was troubled for their sakes; |</verse>
    <verse value="33"> because they were rebellious against his spirit, / he spoke rashly with his lips. |</verse>
    <verse value="34"> They didn't destroy the peoples, / as Yahweh commanded them, /</verse>
    <verse value="35"> but mixed themselves with the nations, / and learned their works. |</verse>
    <verse value="36"> They served their idols, / which became a snare to them. |</verse>
    <verse value="37"> Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons. /</verse>
    <verse value="38"> They shed innocent blood, / even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, / whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. / The land was polluted with blood. |</verse>
    <verse value="39"> Thus were they defiled with their works, / and prostituted themselves in their deeds. |</verse>
    <verse value="40"> Therefore Yahweh burned with anger against his people. / He abhorred his inheritance. |</verse>
    <verse value="41"> He gave them into the hand of the nations. / Those who hated them ruled over them. |</verse>
    <verse value="42"> Their enemies also oppressed them. / They were brought into subjection under their hand. |</verse>
    <verse value="43"> Many times he delivered them, / but they were rebellious in their counsel, / and were brought low in their iniquity. |</verse>
    <verse value="44"> Nevertheless he regarded their distress, / when he heard their cry. |</verse>
    <verse value="45"> He remembered for them his covenant, / and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses. |</verse>
    <verse value="46"> He made them also to be pitied / by all those who carried them captive. |</verse>
    <verse value="47"> Save us, Yahweh, our God, / gather us from among the nations, / to give thanks to your holy name, / to triumph in your praise! |</verse>
    <verse value="48"> Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, / from everlasting even to everlasting! | Let all the people say, "Amen." | Praise Yah! |</verse>
