    <verse value="3"> The wicked go astray from the womb. / They are wayward as soon as they are born, speaking lies. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Their poison is like the poison of a snake; / like a deaf cobra that stops its ear, /</verse>
    <verse value="5"> which doesn't listen to the voice of charmers, / no matter how skillful the charmer may be. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Break their teeth, God, in their mouth. / Break out the great teeth of the young lions, Yahweh. |</verse>

    <verse value="10"> The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance. / He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked; |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> so that men shall say, "Most certainly there is a reward for the righteous. / Most certainly there is a God who judges the earth." |</verse>
