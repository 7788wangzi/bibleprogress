    <verse value="1">Of the children of Ammon. Thus says Yahweh: Has Israel no sons? has he no heir? why then does Malcam possess Gad, and his people well in its cities?</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Therefore behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon; and it shall become a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel possess those who possessed him, says Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste; cry, you daughters of Rabbah, clothe yourself in sackcloth: lament, and run back and forth among the fences; for Malcam shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Why do you glory in the valleys, your flowing valley, backsliding daughter? who trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come to me?</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Behold, I will bring a fear on you, says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, from all who are around you; and you shall be driven out every man right forth, and there shall be none to gather together the fugitives.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon, says Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Of Edom. Thus says Yahweh of Armies: Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Flee, turn back, dwell in the depths, inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau on him, the time that I shall visit him.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> If grape gatherers came to you, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, wouldn't they destroy until they had enough?</verse>
    <verse value="10"> But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is destroyed, and his brothers, and his neighbors; and he is no more.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Leave your fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let your widows trust in me.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> For thus says Yahweh: Behold, they to whom it didn't pertain to drink of the cup shall certainly drink; and are you he who shall altogether go unpunished? You shall not go unpunished, but you shall surely drink.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> For I have sworn by myself, says Yahweh, that Bozrah shall become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all its cities shall be perpetual wastes.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> I have heard news from Yahweh, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, saying, Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> For, behold, I have made you small among the nations, and despised among men.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> As for your terror, the pride of your heart has deceived you, O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, who hold the height of the hill: though you should make your nest as high as the eagle, I will bring you down from there, says Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Edom shall become an astonishment: everyone who passes by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all its plagues.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities of it, says Yahweh, no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man live therein.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoever is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd who will stand before me?</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh, that he has taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they shall drag them away, the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> The earth trembles at the noise of their fall; there is a cry, the noise which is heard in the Red Sea {or, Sea of Reeds}.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread out his wings against Bozrah: and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Of Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad; for they have heard evil news, they are melted away: there is sorrow on the sea; it can't be quiet.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Damascus has grown feeble, she turns herself to flee, and trembling has seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> How is the city of praise not forsaken, the city of my joy?</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, says Yahweh of Armies.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben Hadad.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck. Thus says Yahweh: Arise, go up to Kedar, and destroy the children of the east.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Their tents and their flocks shall they take; they shall carry away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry to them, Terror on every side!</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Flee, wander far off, dwell in the depths, you inhabitants of Hazor, says Yahweh; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has taken counsel against you, and has conceived a purpose against you.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> Arise, go up to a nation that is at ease, that dwells without care, says Yahweh; that have neither gates nor bars, that dwell alone.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> Their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their livestock a spoil: and I will scatter to all winds those who have the corners of their beards cut off; and I will bring their calamity from every side of them, says Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse value="33"> Hazor shall be a dwelling place of jackals, a desolation forever: no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man live therein.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,</verse>
    <verse value="35"> Thus says Yahweh of Armies: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.</verse>
    <verse value="36"> On Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of the sky, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come.</verse>
    <verse value="37"> I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before those who seek their life; and I will bring evil on them, even my fierce anger, says Yahweh; and I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them;</verse>
    <verse value="38"> and I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from there king and princes, says Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse value="39"> But it shall happen in the latter days, that I will bring back the captivity of Elam, says Yahweh. |</verse>
