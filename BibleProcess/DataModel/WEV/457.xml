    <verse value="1">Then Job answered, |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Listen diligently to my speech. / Let this be your consolation. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Allow me, and I also will speak; / After I have spoken, mock on. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> As for me, is my complaint to man? / Why shouldn't I be impatient? |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Look at me, and be astonished. / Lay your hand on your mouth. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> When I remember, I am troubled. / Horror takes hold of my flesh. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> "Why do the wicked live, / become old, yes, and grow mighty in power? |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Their child is established with them in their sight, / their offspring before their eyes. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Their houses are safe from fear, / neither is the rod of God upon them. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Their bulls breed without fail. / Their cows calve, and don't miscarry. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> They send forth their little ones like a flock. / Their children dance. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> They sing to the tambourine and harp, / and rejoice at the sound of the pipe. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> They spend their days in prosperity. / In an instant they go down to Sheol {Sheol is the place of the dead.}. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> They tell God, 'Depart from us, / for we don't want to know about your ways. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? / What profit should we have, if we pray to him?' |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand. / The counsel of the wicked is far from me. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> "How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out, / that their calamity comes on them, / that God distributes sorrows in his anger? |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> How often is it that they are as stubble before the wind, / as chaff that the storm carries away? |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> You say, 'God lays up his iniquity for his children.' / Let him recompense it to himself, that he may know it. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Let his own eyes see his destruction. / Let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> For what does he care for his house after him, / when the number of his months is cut off? |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> "Shall any teach God knowledge, / since he judges those who are high? |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> One dies in his full strength, / being wholly at ease and quiet. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> His pails are full of milk. / The marrow of his bones is moistened. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Another dies in bitterness of soul, / and never tastes of good. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> They lie down alike in the dust. / The worm covers them. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> "Behold, I know your thoughts, / the devices with which you would wrong me. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> For you say, 'Where is the house of the prince? / Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?' |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Haven't you asked wayfaring men? / Don't you know their evidences, |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> that the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity, / That they are led forth to the day of wrath? |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> Who shall declare his way to his face? / Who shall repay him what he has done? |</verse>
    <verse value="32"> Yet he will be borne to the grave. / Men shall keep watch over the tomb. |</verse>
    <verse value="33"> The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him. / All men shall draw after him, / as there were innumerable before him. |</verse>
    <verse value="34"> So how can you comfort me with nonsense, / because in your answers there remains only falsehood?" |</verse>
