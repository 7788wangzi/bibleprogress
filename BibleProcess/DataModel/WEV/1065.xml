    <verse value="1">Brothers, I couldn't speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> I fed you with milk, not with meat; for you weren't yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you ready,</verse>
    <verse value="3"> for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren't you fleshly, and don't you walk in the ways of men?</verse>
    <verse value="4"> For when one says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," aren't you fleshly?</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed; and each as the Lord gave to him?</verse>
    <verse value="6"> I planted. Apollos watered. But God gave the increase.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> For we are God's fellow workers. You are God's farming, God's building.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble;</verse>
    <verse value="13"> each man's work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man's work is.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> If any man's work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> If any man's work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Don't you know that you are a temple of God, and that God's Spirit lives in you?</verse>
    <verse value="17"> If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for God's temple is holy, which you are.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, "He has taken the wise in their craftiness." {Job 5:13}</verse>
    <verse value="20"> And again, "The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless." {Psalm 94:11}</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,</verse>
    <verse value="22"> whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours,</verse>
    <verse value="23"> and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's. |</verse>
