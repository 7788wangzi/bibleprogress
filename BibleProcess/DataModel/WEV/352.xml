    <verse value="1">Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel; for his kingdom was exalted on high, for his people Israel's sake.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> David took more wives at Jerusalem; and David became the father of more sons and daughters.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> These are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,</verse>
    <verse value="5"> and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,</verse>
    <verse value="6"> and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</verse>
    <verse value="7"> and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> When the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out against them.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> David inquired of God, saying, "Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?" | Yahweh said to him, "Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand." |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> So they came up to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there; and David said, God has broken my enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> They left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> The Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> David inquired again of God; and God said to him, "You shall not go up after them. Turn away from them, and come on them over against the mulberry trees.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall go out to battle; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines." |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> David did as God commanded him: and they struck the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> The fame of David went out into all lands; and Yahweh brought the fear of him on all nations. |</verse>
