    <verse value="1">They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> When he had come out of the boat, immediately a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> He lived in the tombs. Nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains,</verse>
    <verse value="4"> because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him,</verse>
    <verse value="7"> and crying out with a loud voice, he said, "What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, don't torment me."</verse>
    <verse value="8"> For he said to him, "Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!" |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> He asked him, "What is your name?" | He said to him, "My name is Legion, for we are many."</verse>
    <verse value="10"> He begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Now on the mountainside there was a great herd of pigs feeding.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> All the demons begged him, saying, "Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them." |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> At once Jesus gave them permission. The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs. The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Those who fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the country. | The people came to see what it was that had happened.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> They came to Jesus, and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, even him who had the legion; and they were afraid.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Those who saw it declared to them how it happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> They began to beg him to depart from their region. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> As he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> He didn't allow him, but said to him, "Go to your house, to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how he had mercy on you." |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> He went his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him, and everyone marveled. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet,</verse>
    <verse value="23"> and begged him much, saying, "My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live." |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> He went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> A certain woman, who had an issue of blood for twelve years,</verse>
    <verse value="26"> and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse,</verse>
    <verse value="27"> having heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd, and touched his clothes.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> For she said, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well."</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction. |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd, and asked, "Who touched my clothes?" |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> His disciples said to him, "You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, 'Who touched me?'" |</verse>
    <verse value="32"> He looked around to see her who had done this thing.</verse>
    <verse value="33"> But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. |</verse>
    <verse value="34"> He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease." |</verse>
    <verse value="35"> While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler's house saying, "Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?" |</verse>
    <verse value="36"> But Jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, "Don't be afraid, only believe."</verse>
    <verse value="37"> He allowed no one to follow him, except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.</verse>
    <verse value="38"> He came to the synagogue ruler's house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing.</verse>
    <verse value="39"> When he had entered in, he said to them, "Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is asleep." |</verse>
    <verse value="40"> They ridiculed him. But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying.</verse>
    <verse value="41"> Taking the child by the hand, he said to her, "Talitha cumi!" which means, being interpreted, "Girl, I tell you, get up!"</verse>
    <verse value="42"> Immediately the girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement.</verse>
    <verse value="43"> He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her to eat. |</verse>
