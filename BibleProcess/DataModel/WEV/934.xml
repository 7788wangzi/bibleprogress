    <verse value="1">Seeing the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain. When he had sat down, his disciples came to him.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> He opened his mouth and taught them, saying, |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> "Blessed are the poor in spirit, / for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. {Isaiah 57:15; 66:2} |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Blessed are those who mourn, / for they shall be comforted. {Isaiah 61:2; 66:10,13} |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Blessed are the gentle, / for they shall inherit the earth. {or, land. Psalm 37:11} |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, / for they shall be filled. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Blessed are the merciful, / for they shall obtain mercy. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Blessed are the pure in heart, / for they shall see God. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Blessed are the peacemakers, / for they shall be called children of God. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness' sake, / for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> "Blessed are you when people reproach you, persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for my sake.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> "You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavor, with what will it be salted? It is then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill can't be hidden.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Neither do you light a lamp, and put it under a measuring basket, but on a stand; and it shines to all who are in the house.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Even so, let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> "Don't think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didn't come to destroy, but to fulfill.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> For most certainly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter {literally, iota} or one tiny pen stroke {or, serif} shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Whoever, therefore, shall break one of these least commandments, and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> "You have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, 'You shall not murder;' {Exodus 20:13} and 'Whoever shall murder shall be in danger of the judgment.'</verse>
    <verse value="22"> But I tell you, that everyone who is angry with his brother without a cause {NU omits "without a cause".} shall be in danger of the judgment; and whoever shall say to his brother, 'Raca {"Raca" is an Aramaic insult, related to the word for "empty" and conveying the idea of empty-headedness.}!' shall be in danger of the council; and whoever shall say, 'You fool!' shall be in danger of the fire of Gehenna. {or, Hell} |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> "If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you,</verse>
    <verse value="24"> leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are with him in the way; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Most certainly I tell you, you shall by no means get out of there, until you have paid the last penny. {literally, kodrantes. A kodrantes was a small copper coin worth about 2 lepta (widow's mites)--not enough to buy very much of anything.} |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> "You have heard that it was said,  {TR adds "to the ancients,"} 'You shall not commit adultery;' {Exodus 20:14}</verse>
    <verse value="28"> but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna. {or, Hell}</verse>
    <verse value="30"> If your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off, and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna. {or, Hell} |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> "It was also said, 'Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce,' {Deuteronomy 24:1}</verse>
    <verse value="32"> but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery. |</verse>
    <verse value="33"> "Again you have heard that it was said to them of old time, 'You shall not make false vows, but shall perform to the Lord your vows,'</verse>
    <verse value="34"> but I tell you, don't swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;</verse>
    <verse value="35"> nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.</verse>
    <verse value="36"> Neither shall you swear by your head, for you can't make one hair white or black.</verse>
    <verse value="37"> But let your 'Yes' be 'Yes' and your 'No' be 'No.' Whatever is more than these is of the evil one. |</verse>
    <verse value="38"> "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.' {Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21}</verse>
    <verse value="39"> But I tell you, don't resist him who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.</verse>
    <verse value="40"> If anyone sues you to take away your coat, let him have your cloak also.</verse>
    <verse value="41"> Whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.</verse>
    <verse value="42"> Give to him who asks you, and don't turn away him who desires to borrow from you. |</verse>
    <verse value="43"> "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor, {Leviticus 19:18} and hate your enemy. {not in the Bible, but see Qumran Manual of Discipline Ix, 21-26}'</verse>
    <verse value="44"> But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you,</verse>
    <verse value="45"> that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.</verse>
    <verse value="46"> For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Don't even the tax collectors do the same?</verse>
    <verse value="47"> If you only greet your friends, what more do you do than others? Don't even the tax collectors {NU reads "Gentiles" instead of "tax collectors".} do the same?</verse>
    <verse value="48"> Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect. |</verse>
