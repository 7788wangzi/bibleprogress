    <verse value="21"> Isaac entreated Yahweh for his wife, because she was barren. Yahweh was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> The children struggled together within her. She said, "If it be so, why do I live?" She went to inquire of Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Yahweh said to her, | "Two nations are in your womb. | Two peoples will be separated from your body. | The one people will be stronger than the other people. | The elder will serve the younger." |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They named him Esau.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau's heel. He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> The boys grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in from the field, and he was famished.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Esau said to Jacob, "Please feed me with that same red stew, for I am famished." Therefore his name was called Edom. |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> Jacob said, "First, sell me your birthright." |</verse>
    <verse value="32"> Esau said, "Behold, I am about to die. What good is the birthright to me?" |</verse>
    <verse value="33"> Jacob said, "Swear to me first." | He swore to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils. He ate and drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright. |</verse>
