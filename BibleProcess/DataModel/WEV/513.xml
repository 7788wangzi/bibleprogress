    <verse value="1">By David. | Contend, Yahweh, with those who contend with me. / Fight against those who fight against me. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Take hold of shield and buckler, / and stand up for my help. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Brandish the spear and block those who pursue me. / Tell my soul, "I am your salvation." |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Let those who seek after my soul be disappointed and brought to dishonor. / Let those who plot my ruin be turned back and confounded. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Let them be as chaff before the wind, / Yahweh's angel driving them on. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Let their way be dark and slippery, / Yahweh's angel pursuing them. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> For without cause they have hidden their net in a pit for me. / Without cause they have dug a pit for my soul. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Let destruction come on him unawares. / Let his net that he has hidden catch himself. / Let him fall into that destruction. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> My soul shall be joyful in Yahweh. / It shall rejoice in his salvation. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> All my bones shall say, "Yahweh, who is like you, / who delivers the poor from him who is too strong for him; / yes, the poor and the needy from him who robs him?" |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Unrighteous witnesses rise up. / They ask me about things that I don't know about. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> They reward me evil for good, / to the bereaving of my soul. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth. / I afflicted my soul with fasting. / My prayer returned into my own bosom. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother. / I bowed down mourning, as one who mourns his mother. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> But in my adversity, they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together. / The attackers gathered themselves together against me, and I didn't know it. / They tore at me, and didn't cease. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Like the profane mockers in feasts, / they gnashed their teeth at me. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Lord, how long will you look on? / Rescue my soul from their destruction, / my precious life from the lions. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> I will give you thanks in the great assembly. / I will praise you among many people. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Don't let those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me; / neither let those who hate me without a cause wink their eyes. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> For they don't speak peace, / but they devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Yes, they opened their mouth wide against me. / They said, "Aha! Aha! Our eye has seen it!" |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> You have seen it, Yahweh. Don't keep silent. / Lord, don't be far from me. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Wake up! Rise up to defend me, my God! / My Lord, contend for me! |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Vindicate me, Yahweh my God, according to your righteousness. / Don't let them gloat over me. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Don't let them say in their heart, "Aha! That's the way we want it!" / Don't let them say, "We have swallowed him up!" |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Let them be disappointed and confounded together who rejoice at my calamity. / Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves against me. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Let them shout for joy and be glad, who favor my righteous cause. / Yes, let them say continually, "Yahweh be magnified, / who has pleasure in the prosperity of his servant!" |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> My tongue shall talk about your righteousness and about your praise all day long. |</verse>
