    <verse value="1">Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don't be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> You are alienated from Christ, you who desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> For we, through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> You were running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?</verse>
    <verse value="8"> This persuasion is not from him who calls you.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> A little yeast grows through the whole lump.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> For you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only don't use your freedom for gain to the flesh, but through love be servants to one another.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." {Leviticus 19:18}</verse>
    <verse value="15"> But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you don't consume one another.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the things that you desire.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Now the works of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,</verse>
    <verse value="20"> idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies,</verse>
    <verse value="21"> envyings, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, {or, faithfulness}</verse>
    <verse value="23"> gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> If we live by the Spirit, let's also walk by the Spirit.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Let's not become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another. |</verse>
