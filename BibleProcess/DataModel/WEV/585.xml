    <verse value="1">Give thanks to Yahweh, {"Yahweh" is God's proper Name, sometimes rendered "LORD" (all caps) in other translations.} / for he is good, | for his loving kindness endures forever. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Let the redeemed by Yahweh say so, / whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary, /</verse>
    <verse value="3"> And gathered out of the lands, / from the east and from the west, / from the north and from the south. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way. / They found no city to live in. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Hungry and thirsty, / their soul fainted in them. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, / and he delivered them out of their distresses, |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> he led them also by a straight way, / that they might go to a city to live in. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, / for his wonderful works to the children of men! |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> For he satisfies the longing soul. / He fills the hungry soul with good. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, / being bound in affliction and iron, /</verse>
    <verse value="11"> because they rebelled against the words of God {The Hebrew word rendered "God" is "Elohim."}, / and condemned the counsel of the Most High. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Therefore he brought down their heart with labor. / They fell down, and there was none to help. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, / and he saved them out of their distresses. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, / and broke their bonds in sunder. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, / for his wonderful works to the children of men! |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> For he has broken the gates of brass, / and cut through bars of iron. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience, / and because of their iniquities. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Their soul abhors all kinds of food. / They draw near to the gates of death. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, / he saves them out of their distresses. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> He sends his word, and heals them, / and delivers them from their graves. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, / for his wonderful works to the children of men! |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, / and declare his works with singing. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Those who go down to the sea in ships, / who do business in great waters; /</verse>
    <verse value="24"> These see Yahweh's works, / and his wonders in the deep. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> For he commands, and raises the stormy wind, / which lifts up its waves. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths. / Their soul melts away because of trouble. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man, / and are at their wits' end. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, / and he brings them out of their distress. |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> He makes the storm a calm, / so that its waves are still. |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Then they are glad because it is calm, / so he brings them to their desired haven. |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, / for his wonderful works for the children of men! |</verse>
    <verse value="32"> Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, / and praise him in the seat of the elders. |</verse>
    <verse value="33"> He turns rivers into a desert, / water springs into a thirsty ground, /</verse>
    <verse value="34"> and a fruitful land into a salt waste, / for the wickedness of those who dwell in it. |</verse>
    <verse value="35"> He turns a desert into a pool of water, / and a dry land into water springs. |</verse>
    <verse value="36"> There he makes the hungry live, / that they may prepare a city to live in, /</verse>
    <verse value="37"> sow fields, plant vineyards, / and reap the fruits of increase. |</verse>
    <verse value="38"> He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly. / He doesn't allow their livestock to decrease. |</verse>
    <verse value="39"> Again, they are diminished and bowed down / through oppression, trouble, and sorrow. |</verse>
    <verse value="40"> He pours contempt on princes, / and causes them to wander in a trackless waste. |</verse>
    <verse value="41"> Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction, / and increases their families like a flock. |</verse>
    <verse value="42"> The upright will see it, and be glad. / All the wicked will shut their mouths. |</verse>
    <verse value="43"> Whoever is wise will pay attention to these things. / They will consider the loving kindnesses of Yahweh. |</verse>
