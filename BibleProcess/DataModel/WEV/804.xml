    <verse value="1">He said to me, Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> The Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard him who spoke to me.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> He said to me, Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a nation of rebels who have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> The children are impudent and stiff-hearted: I am sending you to them; and you shall tell them, Thus says the Lord {The word translated "Lord" is "Adonai."} Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> They, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house), yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> You, son of man, don't be afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you, and you do dwell among scorpions: don't be afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> You shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> But you, son of man, hear what I tell you; don't be rebellious like that rebellious house: open your mouth, and eat that which I give you.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> When I looked, behold, a hand was put forth to me; and, behold, a scroll of a book was therein;</verse>
    <verse value="10"> He spread it before me: and it was written within and without; and there were written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe. |</verse>
