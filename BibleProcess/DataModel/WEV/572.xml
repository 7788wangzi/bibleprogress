    <verse value="6"> They kill the widow and the alien, / and murder the fatherless. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> They say, "Yah will not see, / neither will Jacob's God consider." |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Consider, you senseless among the people; / you fools, when will you be wise? |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> He who implanted the ear, won't he hear? / He who formed the eye, won't he see? |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> He who disciplines the nations, won't he punish? / He who teaches man knows. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Yahweh knows the thoughts of man, / that they are futile. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Blessed is the man whom you discipline, Yah, / and teach out of your law; |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> that you may give him rest from the days of adversity, / until the pit is dug for the wicked. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> For Yahweh won't reject his people, / neither will he forsake his inheritance. |</verse>

    <verse value="16"> Who will rise up for me against the wicked? / Who will stand up for me against the evildoers? |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Unless Yahweh had been my help, / my soul would have soon lived in silence. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> When I said, "My foot is slipping!" / Your loving kindness, Yahweh, held me up. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> In the multitude of my thoughts within me, / your comforts delight my soul. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you, / which brings about mischief by statute? |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, / and condemn the innocent blood. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> But Yahweh has been my high tower, / my God, the rock of my refuge. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> He has brought on them their own iniquity, / and will cut them off in their own wickedness. / Yahweh, our God, will cut them off. |</verse>
