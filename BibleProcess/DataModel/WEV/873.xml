    <verse value="1">"When Israel was a child, then I loved him, / and called my son out of Egypt. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> They called to them, so they went from them. / They sacrificed to the Baals, / and burned incense to engraved images. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Yet I taught Ephraim to walk. / I took them by his arms; / but they didn't know that I healed them. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> I drew them with cords of a man, with ties of love; / and I was to them like those who lift up the yoke on their necks; / and I bent down to him and I fed him. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> "They won't return into the land of Egypt; / but the Assyrian will be their king, / because they refused to repent. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> The sword will fall on their cities, / and will destroy the bars of their gates, / and will put an end to their plans. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> My people are determined to turn from me. / Though they call to the Most High, / he certainly won't exalt them. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> "How can I give you up, Ephraim? / How can I hand you over, Israel? / How can I make you like Admah? / How can I make you like Zeboiim? | My heart is turned within me, / my compassion is aroused. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> I will not execute the fierceness of my anger. / I will not return to destroy Ephraim: / for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of you; / and I will not come in wrath. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> They will walk after Yahweh, / who will roar like a lion; / for he will roar, and the children will come trembling from the west. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> They will come trembling like a bird out of Egypt, / and like a dove out of the land of Assyria; | and I will settle them in their houses," says Yahweh. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood, / and the house of Israel with deceit. / Judah still strays from God, / and is unfaithful to the Holy One. |</verse>
