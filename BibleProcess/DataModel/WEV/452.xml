    <verse value="1">Then Job answered, |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "I have heard many such things. / You are all miserable comforters! |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Shall vain words have an end? / Or what provokes you that you answer? |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> I also could speak as you do. / If your soul were in my soul's place, / I could join words together against you, / and shake my head at you, |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> but I would strengthen you with my mouth. / The solace of my lips would relieve you. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> "Though I speak, my grief is not subsided. / Though I forbear, what am I eased? |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> But now, God, you have surely worn me out. / You have made desolate all my company. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> You have shriveled me up. This is a witness against me. / My leanness rises up against me. / It testifies to my face. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> He has torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me. / He has gnashed on me with his teeth. / My adversary sharpens his eyes on me. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> They have gaped on me with their mouth. / They have struck me on the cheek reproachfully. / They gather themselves together against me. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> God delivers me to the ungodly, / and casts me into the hands of the wicked. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> I was at ease, and he broke me apart. / Yes, he has taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces. / He has also set me up for his target. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> His archers surround me. / He splits my kidneys apart, and does not spare. / He pours out my gall on the ground. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> He breaks me with breach on breach. / He runs on me like a giant. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> I have sewed sackcloth on my skin, / and have thrust my horn in the dust. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> My face is red with weeping. / Deep darkness is on my eyelids. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Although there is no violence in my hands, / and my prayer is pure. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> "Earth, don't cover my blood. / Let my cry have no place to rest. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven. / He who vouches for me is on high. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> My friends scoff at me. / My eyes pour out tears to God, |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> that he would maintain the right of a man with God, / of a son of man with his neighbor! |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> For when a few years have come, / I shall go the way of no return. |</verse>
