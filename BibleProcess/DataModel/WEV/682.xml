    <verse value="1">For, behold, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah supply and support, / the whole supply of bread, / and the whole supply of water; /</verse>
    <verse value="2"> the mighty man, / the man of war, / the judge, / the prophet, / the diviner, / the elder, /</verse>
    <verse value="3"> the captain of fifty, / the honorable man, / the counselor, / the skilled craftsman, / and the clever enchanter. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> I will give boys to be their princes, / and children shall rule over them. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> The people will be oppressed, / everyone by another, / and everyone by his neighbor. | The child will behave himself proudly against the old man, / and the base against the honorable. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Indeed a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying, / "You have clothing, you be our ruler, / and let this ruin be under your hand." |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> In that day he will cry out, saying, "I will not be a healer; / for in my house is neither bread nor clothing. / You shall not make me ruler of the people." |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; / because their tongue and their doings are against Yahweh, | to provoke the eyes of his glory. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> The look of their faces testify against them. / They parade their sin like Sodom. / They don't hide it. / Woe to their soul! / For they have brought disaster upon themselves. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Tell the righteous "Good!" / For they shall eat the fruit of their deeds. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Woe to the wicked! / Disaster is upon them; / for the deeds of his hands will be paid back to him. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> As for my people, children are their oppressors, / and women rule over them. / My people, those who lead you cause you to err, / and destroy the way of your paths. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Yahweh stands up to contend, / and stands to judge the peoples. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Yahweh will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, / and their leaders: / "It is you who have eaten up the vineyard. / The spoil of the poor is in your houses. /</verse>
    <verse value="15"> What do you mean that you crush my people, / and grind the face of the poor?" says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Moreover Yahweh said, "Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, / and walk with outstretched necks and flirting eyes, / walking to trip as they go, / jingling ornaments on their feet; |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> therefore the Lord brings sores on the crown of the head of the women of Zion, / and Yahweh will make their scalps bald." |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, the headbands, the crescent necklaces,</verse>
    <verse value="19"> the earrings, the bracelets, the veils,</verse>
    <verse value="20"> the headdresses, the ankle chains, the sashes, the perfume bottles, the charms,</verse>
    <verse value="21"> the signet rings, the nose rings,</verse>
    <verse value="22"> the fine robes, the capes, the cloaks, the purses,</verse>
    <verse value="23"> the hand mirrors, the fine linen garments, the tiaras, and the shawls. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> It shall happen that instead of sweet spices, there shall be rottenness; / instead of a belt, a rope; / instead of well set hair, baldness; / instead of a robe, a wearing of sackcloth; / and branding instead of beauty. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Your men shall fall by the sword, / and your mighty in the war. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Her gates shall lament and mourn; / and she shall be desolate and sit on the ground. |</verse>
