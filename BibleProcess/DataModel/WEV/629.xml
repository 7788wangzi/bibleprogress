    <verse value="1">The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel: |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> to know wisdom and instruction; / to discern the words of understanding; |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> to receive instruction in wise dealing, / in righteousness, justice, and equity; |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> to give prudence to the simple, / knowledge and discretion to the young man: |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; / that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel: |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> to understand a proverb, and parables, / the words and riddles of the wise. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> The fear of Yahweh {"Yahweh" is God's proper Name, sometimes rendered "LORD" (all caps) in other translations.} is the beginning of knowledge; / but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> My son, listen to your father's instruction, / and don't forsake your mother's teaching: |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> for they will be a garland to grace your head, / and chains around your neck. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> My son, if sinners entice you, don't consent. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> If they say, "Come with us, / Let's lay in wait for blood; / let's lurk secretly for the innocent without cause; |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> let's swallow them up alive like Sheol {Sheol is the place of the dead.}, / and whole, like those who go down into the pit. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> We'll find all valuable wealth. / We'll fill our houses with spoil. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> You shall cast your lot among us. / We'll all have one purse." |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> My son, don't walk in the way with them. / Keep your foot from their path, |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> for their feet run to evil. / They hurry to shed blood. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird: |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> but these lay wait for their own blood. / They lurk secretly for their own lives. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain. / It takes away the life of its owners. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Wisdom calls aloud in the street. / She utters her voice in the public squares. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> She calls at the head of noisy places. / At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words: |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> "How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? / How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery, / and fools hate knowledge? |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Turn at my reproof. / Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you. / I will make known my words to you. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Because I have called, and you have refused; / I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention; |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> but you have ignored all my counsel, / and wanted none of my reproof; |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> I also will laugh at your disaster. / I will mock when calamity overtakes you; |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> when calamity overtakes you like a storm, / when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind; / when distress and anguish come on you. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Then will they call on me, but I will not answer. / They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me; |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> because they hated knowledge, / and didn't choose the fear of Yahweh. |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> They wanted none of my counsel. / They despised all my reproof. |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way, / and be filled with their own schemes. |</verse>
    <verse value="32"> For the backsliding of the simple will kill them. / The careless ease of fools will destroy them. |</verse>
    <verse value="33"> But whoever listens to me will dwell securely, / and will be at ease, without fear of harm." |</verse>
