    <verse value="1">Moreover Elihu answered, |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Do you think this to be your right, / or do you say, 'My righteousness is more than God's,' |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> That you ask, 'What advantage will it be to you? / What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?' |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> I will answer you, / and your companions with you. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Look to the heavens, and see. / See the skies, which are higher than you. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> If you have sinned, what effect do you have against him? / If your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him? |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> If you are righteous, what do you give him? / Or what does he receive from your hand? |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are, / and your righteousness may profit a son of man. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> "By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out. / They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> But none says, 'Where is God my Maker, / who gives songs in the night, |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> who teaches us more than the animals of the earth, / and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?' |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> There they cry, but none gives answer, / because of the pride of evil men. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Surely God will not hear an empty cry, / neither will the Almighty regard it. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> How much less when you say you don't see him. / The cause is before him, and you wait for him! |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> But now, because he has not visited in his anger, / neither does he greatly regard arrogance. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Therefore Job opens his mouth with empty talk, / and he multiplies words without knowledge." |</verse>
