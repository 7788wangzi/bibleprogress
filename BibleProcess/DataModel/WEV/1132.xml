    <verse value="1">Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,</verse>
    <verse value="2"> to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,</verse>
    <verse value="5"> not by works of righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,</verse>
    <verse value="6"> whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior;</verse>
    <verse value="7"> that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men;</verse>
    <verse value="9"> but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning;</verse>
    <verse value="11"> knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen. |</verse>
