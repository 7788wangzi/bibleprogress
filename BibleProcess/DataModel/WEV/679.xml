    <verse value="1">Oh that you were like my brother, / who nursed from the breasts of my mother! | If I found you outside, I would kiss you; / yes, and no one would despise me. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> I would lead you, bringing you into my mother's house, / who would instruct me. | I would have you drink spiced wine, / of the juice of my pomegranate. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> His left hand would be under my head. / His right hand would embrace me. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, / that you not stir up, nor awaken love, / until it so desires. | Friends |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Who is this who comes up from the wilderness, / leaning on her beloved? | Under the apple tree I aroused you. / There your mother conceived you. / There she was in labor and bore you. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Set me as a seal on your heart, / as a seal on your arm; / for love is strong as death. / Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol {Sheol is the place of the dead.}. / Its flashes are flashes of fire, / a very flame of Yahweh. {"Yahweh" is God's proper Name, sometimes rendered "LORD" (all caps) in other translations.} |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Many waters can't quench love, / neither can floods drown it. | If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love, / he would be utterly scorned. | Friends |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> We have a little sister. / She has no breasts. | What shall we do for our sister / in the day when she is to be spoken for? |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> If she is a wall, / we will build on her a turret of silver. | if she is a door, / we will enclose her with boards of cedar. | Beloved |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> I am a wall, and my breasts like towers, / then I was in his eyes like one who found peace. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon. / He leased out the vineyard to keepers. / Each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> My own vineyard is before me. / The thousand are for you, Solomon; / two hundred for those who tend its fruit. | Lover |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> You who dwell in the gardens, with friends in attendance, / let me hear your voice! | Beloved |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Come away, my beloved! / Be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices! |</verse>
