    <verse value="1">Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of livestock: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that behold, the place was a place for livestock;</verse>
    <verse value="2"> the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying,</verse>
    <verse value="3"> "Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon,</verse>
    <verse value="4"> the land which Yahweh struck before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock; and your servants have livestock."</verse>
    <verse value="5"> They said, "If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession; don't bring us over the Jordan." |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Moses said to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, "Shall your brothers go to the war, and shall you sit here?</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Why do you discourage the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which Yahweh has given them?</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Your fathers did so when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which Yahweh had given them.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Yahweh's anger was kindled in that day, and he swore, saying,</verse>
    <verse value="11"> 'Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:</verse>
    <verse value="12"> except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; because they have followed Yahweh completely.'</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Yahweh's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander back and forth in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, who had done evil in the sight of Yahweh, was consumed. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> "Behold, you have risen up in your fathers' place, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of Yahweh toward Israel.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you will destroy all this people." |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> They came near to him, and said, "We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones:</verse>
    <verse value="17"> but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> We will not return to our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan, and forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward." |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Moses said to them, "If you will do this thing, if you will arm yourselves to go before Yahweh to the war,</verse>
    <verse value="21"> and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before Yahweh, until he has driven out his enemies from before him,</verse>
    <verse value="22"> and the land is subdued before Yahweh; then afterward you shall return, and be guiltless towards Yahweh, and towards Israel; and this land shall be to you for a possession before Yahweh. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> "But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against Yahweh; and be sure your sin will find you out.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Build cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth." |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> The children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, "Your servants will do as my lord commands.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock, shall be there in the cities of Gilead;</verse>
    <verse value="27"> but your servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war, before Yahweh to battle, as my lord says." |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> So Moses commanded concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers' households of the tribes of the children of Israel.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Moses said to them, "If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man who is armed to battle, before Yahweh, and the land shall be subdued before you; then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:</verse>
    <verse value="30"> but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan." |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> The children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, "As Yahweh has said to your servants, so will we do.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> We will pass over armed before Yahweh into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan." |</verse>
    <verse value="33"> Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to its cities and borders, even the cities of the surrounding land.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> The children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,</verse>
    <verse value="35"> and Atrothshophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah,</verse>
    <verse value="36"> and Beth Nimrah, and Beth Haran: fortified cities, and folds for sheep.</verse>
    <verse value="37"> The children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,</verse>
    <verse value="38"> and Nebo, and Baal Meon, (their names being changed), and Sibmah: and they gave other names to the cities which they built.</verse>
    <verse value="39"> The children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were therein.</verse>
    <verse value="40"> Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh; and he lived therein.</verse>
    <verse value="41"> Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its towns, and called them Havvoth Jair.</verse>
    <verse value="42"> Nobah went and took Kenath, and its villages, and called it Nobah, after his own name. |</verse>
