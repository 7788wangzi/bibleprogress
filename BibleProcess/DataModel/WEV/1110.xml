    <verse value="1">If then you were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> When Christ, our life, is revealed, then you will also be revealed with him in glory.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth: sexual immorality, uncleanness, depraved passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry;</verse>
    <verse value="6"> for which things' sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> You also once walked in those, when you lived in them;</verse>
    <verse value="8"> but now you also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and shameful speaking out of your mouth.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Don't lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings,</verse>
    <verse value="10"> and have put on the new man, who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator,</verse>
    <verse value="11"> where there can't be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondservant, freeman; but Christ is all, and in all. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Put on therefore, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, humility, and perseverance;</verse>
    <verse value="13"> bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as Christ forgave you, so you also do. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Above all these things, walk in love, which is the bond of perfection.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to the Lord. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Whatever you do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father, through him. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Husbands, love your wives, and don't be bitter against them. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Children, obey your parents in all things, for this pleases the Lord. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Fathers, don't provoke your children, so that they won't be discouraged. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Servants, obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh, not just when they are looking, as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> And whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord, and not for men,</verse>
    <verse value="24"> knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> But he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done, and there is no partiality. |</verse>
