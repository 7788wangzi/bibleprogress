    <verse value="1">A meditation by David, which he sang to Yahweh, concerning the words of Cush, the Benjamite. | Yahweh, my God, I take refuge in you. / Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me, |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> lest they tear apart my soul like a lion, / ripping it in pieces, while there is none to deliver. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Yahweh, my God, if I have done this, / if there is iniquity in my hands, |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me / (yes, if I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary), /</verse>
    <verse value="5"> let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; | yes, let him tread my life down to the earth, / and lay my glory in the dust. | Selah. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Arise, Yahweh, in your anger. / Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries. | Awake for me. You have commanded judgment. /</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Let the congregation of the peoples surround you. / Rule over them on high. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Yahweh administers judgment to the peoples. / Judge me, Yahweh, according to my righteousness, / and to my integrity that is in me. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, / but establish the righteous; / their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous God. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> My shield is with God, / who saves the upright in heart. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> God is a righteous judge, / yes, a God who has indignation every day. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> If a man doesn't relent, he will sharpen his sword; / he has bent and strung his bow. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death. / He makes ready his flaming arrows. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Behold, he travails with iniquity. / Yes, he has conceived mischief, / and brought forth falsehood. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> He has dug a hole, / and has fallen into the pit which he made. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> The trouble he causes shall return to his own head. / His violence shall come down on the crown of his own head. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> I will give thanks to Yahweh according to his righteousness, / and will sing praise to the name of Yahweh Most High. |</verse>
