    <verse value="1">Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold, the tears of those who were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Therefore I praised the dead who have been long dead more than the living who are yet alive.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Yes, better than them both is him who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Then I saw all the labor and achievement that is the envy of a man's neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> The fool folds his hands together and ruins himself.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and chasing after wind. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> There is one who is alone, and he has neither son nor brother. There is no end to all of his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with wealth. "For whom then, do I labor, and deprive my soul of enjoyment?" This also is vanity. Yes, it is a miserable business. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him who is alone when he falls, and doesn't have another to lift him up.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one keep warm alone?</verse>
    <verse value="12"> If a man prevails against one who is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who doesn't know how to receive admonition any more.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> For out of prison he came forth to be king; yes, even in his kingdom he was born poor.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> I saw all the living who walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the other, who succeeded him.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was--yet those who come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a chasing after wind. |</verse>
