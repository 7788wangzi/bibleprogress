    <verse value="1">Then Bildad the Shuhite answered, |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "How long will you speak these things? / Shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind? |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Does God pervert justice? / Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness? |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> If your children have sinned against him, / He has delivered them into the hand of their disobedience. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> If you want to seek God diligently, / make your supplication to the Almighty. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> If you were pure and upright, / surely now he would awaken for you, | and make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous. /</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Though your beginning was small, | yet your latter end would greatly increase. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> "Please inquire of past generations. / Find out about the learning of their fathers. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, / because our days on earth are a shadow.) |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Shall they not teach you, tell you, / and utter words out of their heart? |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> "Can the papyrus grow up without mire? / Can the rushes grow without water? |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> While it is yet in its greenness, not cut down, / it withers before any other reed. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> So are the paths of all who forget God. / The hope of the godless man shall perish, |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Whose confidence shall break apart, / Whose trust is a spider's web. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> He shall lean on his house, but it shall not stand. / He shall cling to it, but it shall not endure. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> He is green before the sun. / His shoots go forth over his garden. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> His roots are wrapped around the rock pile. / He sees the place of stones. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> If he is destroyed from his place, / then it shall deny him, saying, 'I have not seen you.' |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Behold, this is the joy of his way: / out of the earth, others shall spring. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> "Behold, God will not cast away a blameless man, / neither will he uphold the evildoers. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> He will still fill your mouth with laughter, / your lips with shouting. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Those who hate you shall be clothed with shame. / The tent of the wicked shall be no more." |</verse>
