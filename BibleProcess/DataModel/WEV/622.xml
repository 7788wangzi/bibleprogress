    <verse value="1">By David. | Blessed be Yahweh, my rock, / who teaches my hands to war, / and my fingers to battle: |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> my loving kindness, my fortress, / my high tower, my deliverer, / my shield, and he in whom I take refuge; / who subdues my people under me. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Yahweh, what is man, that you care for him? / Or the son of man, that you think of him? |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Man is like a breath. / His days are like a shadow that passes away. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Part your heavens, Yahweh, and come down. / Touch the mountains, and they will smoke. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Throw out lightning, and scatter them. / Send out your arrows, and rout them. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Stretch out your hand from above, / rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, / out of the hands of foreigners; /</verse>
    <verse value="8"> whose mouths speak deceit, / Whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> I will sing a new song to you, God. / On a ten-stringed lyre, I will sing praises to you. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> You are he who gives salvation to kings, / who rescues David, his servant, from the deadly sword. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hands of foreigners, / whose mouths speak deceit, / whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Then our sons will be like well-nurtured plants, / our daughters like pillars carved to adorn a palace. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Our barns are full, filled with all kinds of provision. / Our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Our oxen will pull heavy loads. / There is no breaking in, and no going away, / and no outcry in our streets. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Happy are the people who are in such a situation. / Happy are the people whose God is Yahweh. |  {} |</verse>
