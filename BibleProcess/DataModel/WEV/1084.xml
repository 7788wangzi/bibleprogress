    <verse value="1">Working together, we entreat also that you not receive the grace of God in vain,</verse>
    <verse value="2"> for he says, | "At an acceptable time I listened to you, | in a day of salvation I helped you." {Isaiah 49:8} | Behold, now is the acceptable time. Behold, now is the day of salvation.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> We give no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our service may not be blamed,</verse>
    <verse value="4"> but in everything commending ourselves, as servants of God, in great endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,</verse>
    <verse value="5"> in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;</verse>
    <verse value="6"> in pureness, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love,</verse>
    <verse value="7"> in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,</verse>
    <verse value="8"> by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;</verse>
    <verse value="9"> as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and not killed;</verse>
    <verse value="10"> as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians. Our heart is enlarged.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Now in return, I speak as to my children, you also be open wide.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Don't be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?</verse>
    <verse value="15"> What agreement has Christ with Belial? Or what portion has a believer with an unbeliever?</verse>
    <verse value="16"> What agreement has a temple of God with idols? For you are a temple of the living God. Even as God said, "I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people." {Leviticus 26:12; Jeremiah 32:38; Ezekiel 37:27}</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Therefore | "'Come out from among them, / and be separate,' says the Lord. | 'Touch no unclean thing. / I will receive you. {Isaiah 52:11; Ezekiel 20:34,41} |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> I will be to you a Father. / You will be to me sons and daughters,' | says the Lord Almighty." {2 Samuel 7:14; 7:8} |</verse>
