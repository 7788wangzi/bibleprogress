    <verse value="4"> He will cover you with his feathers. / Under his wings you will take refuge. / His faithfulness is your shield and rampart. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, / nor of the arrow that flies by day; /</verse>
    <verse value="6"> nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, / nor of the destruction that wastes at noonday. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> A thousand may fall at your side, / and ten thousand at your right hand; / but it will not come near you. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> You will only look with your eyes, / and see the recompense of the wicked. |</verse>

    <verse value="14"> "Because he has set his love on me, therefore I will deliver him. / I will set him on high, because he has known my name. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> He will call on me, and I will answer him. / I will be with him in trouble. / I will deliver him, and honor him. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> I will satisfy him with long life, / and show him my salvation." |</verse>
