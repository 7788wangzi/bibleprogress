    <verse value="1">Better is the poor who walks in his integrity / than he who is perverse in his lips and is a fool. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> It isn't good to have zeal without knowledge; / nor being hasty with one's feet and missing the way. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> The foolishness of man subverts his way; / his heart rages against Yahweh. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Wealth adds many friends, / but the poor is separated from his friend. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> A false witness shall not be unpunished. / He who pours out lies shall not go free. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Many will entreat the favor of a ruler, / and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> All the relatives of the poor shun him: / how much more do his friends avoid him! / He pursues them with pleas, but they are gone. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> He who gets wisdom loves his own soul. / He who keeps understanding shall find good. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> A false witness shall not be unpunished. / He who utters lies shall perish. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Delicate living is not appropriate for a fool, / much less for a servant to have rule over princes. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger. / It is his glory to overlook an offense. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> The king's wrath is like the roaring of a lion, / but his favor is like dew on the grass. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> A foolish son is the calamity of his father. / A wife's quarrels are a continual dripping. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> House and riches are an inheritance from fathers, / but a prudent wife is from Yahweh. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep. / The idle soul shall suffer hunger. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul, / but he who is contemptuous in his ways shall die. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> He who has pity on the poor lends to Yahweh; / he will reward him. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Discipline your son, for there is hope; / don't be a willing party to his death. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> A hot-tempered man must pay the penalty, / for if you rescue him, you must do it again. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Listen to counsel and receive instruction, / that you may be wise in your latter end. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> There are many plans in a man's heart, / but Yahweh's counsel will prevail. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> That which makes a man to be desired is his kindness. / A poor man is better than a liar. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> The fear of Yahweh leads to life, then contentment; / he rests and will not be touched by trouble. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; / he will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Flog a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; / rebuke one who has understanding, and he will gain knowledge. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> He who robs his father and drives away his mother, / is a son who causes shame and brings reproach. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> If you stop listening to instruction, my son, / you will stray from the words of knowledge. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> A corrupt witness mocks justice, / and the mouth of the wicked gulps down iniquity. |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Penalties are prepared for scoffers, / and beatings for the backs of fools. |</verse>
