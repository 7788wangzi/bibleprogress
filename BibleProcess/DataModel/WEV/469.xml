    <verse value="1">"However, Job, please hear my speech, / and listen to all my words. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> See now, I have opened my mouth. / My tongue has spoken in my mouth. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart. / That which my lips know they shall speak sincerely. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> The Spirit of God has made me, / and the breath of the Almighty gives me life. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> If you can, answer me. / Set your words in order before me, and stand forth. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Behold, I am toward God even as you are. / I am also formed out of the clay. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Behold, my terror shall not make you afraid, / neither shall my pressure be heavy on you. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> "Surely you have spoken in my hearing, / I have heard the voice of your words, saying, |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> 'I am clean, without disobedience. / I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Behold, he finds occasions against me. / He counts me for his enemy. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> He puts my feet in the stocks. / He marks all my paths.' |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> "Behold, I will answer you. In this you are not just, / for God is greater than man. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Why do you strive against him, / because he doesn't give account of any of his matters? |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> For God speaks once, / yes twice, though man pays no attention. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> In a dream, in a vision of the night, / when deep sleep falls on men, / in slumbering on the bed; |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Then he opens the ears of men, / and seals their instruction, |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> That he may withdraw man from his purpose, / and hide pride from man. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> He keeps back his soul from the pit, / and his life from perishing by the sword. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> He is chastened also with pain on his bed, / with continual strife in his bones; |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> So that his life abhors bread, / and his soul dainty food. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> His flesh is so consumed away, that it can't be seen. / His bones that were not seen stick out. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Yes, his soul draws near to the pit, / and his life to the destroyers. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> "If there is beside him an angel, / an interpreter, one among a thousand, / to show to man what is right for him; |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> then God is gracious to him, and says, / 'Deliver him from going down to the pit, / I have found a ransom.' |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> His flesh shall be fresher than a child's. / He returns to the days of his youth. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> He prays to God, and he is favorable to him, / so that he sees his face with joy. / He restores to man his righteousness. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> He sings before men, and says, / 'I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, / and it didn't profit me. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit. / My life shall see the light.' |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> "Behold, God works all these things, / twice, yes three times, with a man, |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> to bring back his soul from the pit, / that he may be enlightened with the light of the living. |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> Mark well, Job, and listen to me. / Hold your peace, and I will speak. |</verse>
    <verse value="32"> If you have anything to say, answer me. / Speak, for I desire to justify you. |</verse>
    <verse value="33"> If not, listen to me. / Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom." |</verse>
