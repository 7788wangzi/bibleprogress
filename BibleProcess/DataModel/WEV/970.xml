    <verse value="1">As he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Teacher, see what kind of stones and what kind of buildings!" |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Jesus said to him, "Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone on another, which will not be thrown down." |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> As he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,</verse>
    <verse value="4"> "Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are all about to be fulfilled?" |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Jesus, answering, began to tell them, "Be careful that no one leads you astray.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he! {or, "I AM!"}' and will lead many astray. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> "When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't be troubled. For those must happen, but the end is not yet.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places. There will be famines and troubles. These things are the beginning of birth pains.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> But watch yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils. You will be beaten in synagogues. You will stand before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> The Good News must first be preached to all the nations.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> When they lead you away and deliver you up, don't be anxious beforehand, or premeditate what you will say, but say whatever will be given you in that hour. For it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> "Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> You will be hated by all men for my name's sake, but he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> But when you see the abomination of desolation, {Daniel 9:17; 11:31; 12:11} spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains,</verse>
    <verse value="15"> and let him who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter in, to take anything out of his house.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Let him who is in the field not return back to take his cloak.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> But woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse babies in those days!</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Pray that your flight won't be in the winter.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> For in those days there will be oppression, such as there has not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will be.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Unless the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the sake of the chosen ones, whom he picked out, he shortened the days.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Then if anyone tells you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'Look, there!' don't believe it.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> For there will arise false christs and false prophets, and will show signs and wonders, that they may lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> But you watch. | "Behold, I have told you all things beforehand.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> But in those days, after that oppression, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light,</verse>
    <verse value="25"> the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken. {Isaiah 13:10; 34:4}</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Then he will send out his angels, and will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the sky. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> "Now from the fig tree, learn this parable. When the branch has now become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near;</verse>
    <verse value="29"> even so you also, when you see these things coming to pass, know that it is near, at the doors.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Most certainly I say to you, this generation {The word translated "generation" (genea) could also be translated "race," "family," or "people."} will not pass away until all these things happen.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> But of that day or that hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.</verse>
    <verse value="33"> Watch, keep alert, and pray; for you don't know when the time is. |</verse>
    <verse value="34"> "It is like a man, traveling to another country, having left his house, and given authority to his servants, and to each one his work, and also commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch.</verse>
    <verse value="35"> Watch therefore, for you don't know when the lord of the house is coming, whether at evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning;</verse>
    <verse value="36"> lest coming suddenly he might find you sleeping.</verse>
    <verse value="37"> What I tell you, I tell all: Watch." |</verse>
