    <verse value="1">Behold, you are beautiful, my love. / Behold, you are beautiful. | Your eyes are doves behind your veil. / Your hair is as a flock of goats, / that descend from Mount Gilead. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Your teeth are like a newly shorn flock, / which have come up from the washing, / where every one of them has twins. / None is bereaved among them. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Your lips are like scarlet thread. / Your mouth is lovely. / Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Your neck is like David's tower built for an armory, / whereon a thousand shields hang, / all the shields of the mighty men. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Your two breasts are like two fawns / that are twins of a roe, / which feed among the lilies. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, / I will go to the mountain of myrrh, / to the hill of frankincense. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> You are all beautiful, my love. / There is no spot in you. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, / with me from Lebanon. / Look from the top of Amana, / from the top of Senir and Hermon, / from the lions' dens, / from the mountains of the leopards. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride. / You have ravished my heart with one of your eyes, / with one chain of your neck. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride! / How much better is your love than wine! / The fragrance of your perfumes than all kinds of spices! |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Your lips, my bride, drip like the honeycomb. / Honey and milk are under your tongue. / The smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> A locked up garden is my sister, my bride; / a locked up spring, / a sealed fountain. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits: / henna with spikenard plants, /</verse>
    <verse value="14"> spikenard and saffron, / calamus and cinnamon, with every kind of incense tree; / myrrh and aloes, with all the best spices, /</verse>
    <verse value="15"> a fountain of gardens, / a well of living waters, / flowing streams from Lebanon. | Beloved |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Awake, north wind; and come, you south! / Blow on my garden, that its spices may flow out. | Let my beloved come into his garden, / and taste his precious fruits. | Lover |</verse>
