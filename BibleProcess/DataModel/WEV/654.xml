    <verse value="1">Like snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, / so honor is not fitting for a fool. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Like a fluttering sparrow, / like a darting swallow, / so the undeserved curse doesn't come to rest. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> A whip is for the horse, / a bridle for the donkey, / and a rod for the back of fools! |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Don't answer a fool according to his folly, / lest you also be like him. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Answer a fool according to his folly, / lest he be wise in his own eyes. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> One who sends a message by the hand of a fool / is cutting off feet and drinking violence. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Like the legs of the lame that hang loose: / so is a parable in the mouth of fools. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> As one who binds a stone in a sling, / so is he who gives honor to a fool. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Like a thornbush that goes into the hand of a drunkard, / so is a parable in the mouth of fools. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> As an archer who wounds all, / so is he who hires a fool / or he who hires those who pass by. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> As a dog that returns to his vomit, / so is a fool who repeats his folly. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? / There is more hope for a fool than for him. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> The sluggard says, "There is a lion in the road! / A fierce lion roams the streets!" |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> As the door turns on its hinges, / so does the sluggard on his bed. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> The sluggard buries his hand in the dish. / He is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes / than seven men who answer with discretion. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Like one who grabs a dog's ears / is one who passes by and meddles in a quarrel not his own. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Like a madman who shoots torches, arrows, and death, /</verse>
    <verse value="19"> is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, "Am I not joking?" |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> For lack of wood a fire goes out. / Without gossip, a quarrel dies down. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> As coals are to hot embers, / and wood to fire, / so is a contentious man to kindling strife. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, / they go down into the innermost parts. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Like silver dross on an earthen vessel / are the lips of a fervent one with an evil heart. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> A malicious man disguises himself with his lips, / but he harbors evil in his heart. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> When his speech is charming, don't believe him; / for there are seven abominations in his heart. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> His malice may be concealed by deception, / but his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it. / Whoever rolls a stone, it will come back on him. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> A lying tongue hates those it hurts; / and a flattering mouth works ruin. |</verse>
