    <verse value="1">This is a faithful saying: if a man seeks the office of an overseer {or, superintendents, or bishops}, he desires a good work.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> The overseer therefore must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, modest, hospitable, good at teaching;</verse>
    <verse value="3"> not a drinker, not violent, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous;</verse>
    <verse value="4"> one who rules his own house well, having children in subjection with all reverence;</verse>
    <verse value="5"> (but if a man doesn't know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the assembly of God?)</verse>
    <verse value="6"> not a new convert, lest being puffed up he fall into the same condemnation as the devil.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside, to avoid falling into reproach and the snare of the devil. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Servants {or, Deacons.}, in the same way, must be reverent, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for money;</verse>
    <verse value="9"> holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Let them also first be tested; then let them serve {or, serve as deacons} if they are blameless.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Their wives in the same way must be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Let servants {or, deacons} be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> For those who have served well {or, served well as deacons} gain for themselves a good standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly;</verse>
    <verse value="15"> but if I wait long, that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in God's house, which is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Without controversy, the mystery of godliness is great: | God was revealed in the flesh, / justified in the spirit, / seen by angels, / preached among the nations, / believed on in the world, / and received up in glory. |</verse>
