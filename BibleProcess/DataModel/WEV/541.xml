    <verse value="1">A Psalm by David, when he was in the desert of Judah. | God, you are my God. / I will earnestly seek you. | My soul thirsts for you. / My flesh longs for you, / in a dry and weary land, where there is no water. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> So I have seen you in the sanctuary, / watching your power and your glory. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Because your loving kindness is better than life, / my lips shall praise you. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> So I will bless you while I live. / I will lift up my hands in your name. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> My soul shall be satisfied as with the richest food. / My mouth shall praise you with joyful lips, /</verse>
    <verse value="6"> when I remember you on my bed, / and think about you in the night watches. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> For you have been my help. / I will rejoice in the shadow of your wings. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> My soul stays close to you. / Your right hand holds me up. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> But those who seek my soul, to destroy it, / shall go into the lower parts of the earth. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> They shall be given over to the power of the sword. / They shall be jackal food. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> But the king shall rejoice in God. / Everyone who swears by him will praise him, / for the mouth of those who speak lies shall be silenced. |</verse>
