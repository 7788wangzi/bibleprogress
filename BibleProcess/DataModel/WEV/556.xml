    <verse value="1">A contemplation by Asaph. | Hear my teaching, my people. / Turn your ears to the words of my mouth. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> I will open my mouth in a parable. / I will utter dark sayings of old, |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Which we have heard and known, / and our fathers have told us. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> We will not hide them from their children, / telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh, / his strength, and his wondrous works that he has done. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> For he established a testimony in Jacob, / and appointed a teaching in Israel, / which he commanded our fathers, / that they should make them known to their children; |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born; / who should arise and tell their children, |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> that they might set their hope in God, / and not forget the works of God, / but keep his commandments, |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> and might not be as their fathers, / a stubborn and rebellious generation, / a generation that didn't make their hearts loyal, / whose spirit was not steadfast with God. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, / turned back in the day of battle. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> They didn't keep God's covenant, / and refused to walk in his law. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> They forgot his doings, / his wondrous works that he had shown them. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, / in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> He split the sea, and caused them to pass through. / He made the waters stand as a heap. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> In the daytime he also led them with a cloud, / and all night with a light of fire. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> He split rocks in the wilderness, / and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> He brought streams also out of the rock, / and caused waters to run down like rivers. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Yet they still went on to sin against him, / to rebel against the Most High in the desert. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> They tempted God in their heart / by asking food according to their desire. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Yes, they spoke against God. / They said, "Can God prepare a table in the wilderness? |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out, / and streams overflowed. | Can he give bread also? / Will he provide flesh for his people?" |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry. / A fire was kindled against Jacob, / anger also went up against Israel, |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> because they didn't believe in God, / and didn't trust in his salvation. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Yet he commanded the skies above, / and opened the doors of heaven. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> He rained down manna on them to eat, / and gave them food from the sky. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Man ate the bread of angels. / He sent them food to the full. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> He caused the east wind to blow in the sky. / By his power he guided the south wind. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> He rained also flesh on them as the dust; / winged birds as the sand of the seas. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> He let them fall in the midst of their camp, / around their habitations. |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> So they ate, and were well filled. / He gave them their own desire. |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> They didn't turn from their cravings. / Their food was yet in their mouths, /</verse>
    <verse value="31"> when the anger of God went up against them, / killed some of their fattest, / and struck down the young men of Israel. |</verse>
    <verse value="32"> For all this they still sinned, / and didn't believe in his wondrous works. |</verse>
    <verse value="33"> Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, / and their years in terror. |</verse>
    <verse value="34"> When he killed them, then they inquired after him. / They returned and sought God earnestly. |</verse>
    <verse value="35"> They remembered that God was their rock, / the Most High God, their redeemer. |</verse>
    <verse value="36"> But they flattered him with their mouth, / and lied to him with their tongue. |</verse>
    <verse value="37"> For their heart was not right with him, / neither were they faithful in his covenant. |</verse>
    <verse value="38"> But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn't destroy them. / Yes, many times he turned his anger away, / and didn't stir up all his wrath. |</verse>
    <verse value="39"> He remembered that they were but flesh, / a wind that passes away, and doesn't come again. |</verse>
    <verse value="40"> How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, / and grieved him in the desert! |</verse>
    <verse value="41"> They turned again and tempted God, / and provoked the Holy One of Israel. |</verse>
    <verse value="42"> They didn't remember his hand, / nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary; |</verse>
    <verse value="43"> how he set his signs in Egypt, / his wonders in the field of Zoan, |</verse>
    <verse value="44"> he turned their rivers into blood, / and their streams, so that they could not drink. |</verse>
    <verse value="45"> He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; / and frogs, which destroyed them. |</verse>
    <verse value="46"> He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, / and their labor to the locust. |</verse>
    <verse value="47"> He destroyed their vines with hail, / their sycamore fig trees with frost. |</verse>
    <verse value="48"> He gave over their livestock also to the hail, / and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. |</verse>
    <verse value="49"> He threw on them the fierceness of his anger, / wrath, indignation, and trouble, / and a band of angels of evil. |</verse>
    <verse value="50"> He made a path for his anger. / He didn't spare their soul from death, / but gave their life over to the pestilence, |</verse>
    <verse value="51"> and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, / the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham. |</verse>
    <verse value="52"> But he led forth his own people like sheep, / and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. |</verse>
    <verse value="53"> He led them safely, so that they weren't afraid, / but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. |</verse>
    <verse value="54"> He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, / to this mountain, which his right hand had taken. |</verse>
    <verse value="55"> He also drove out the nations before them, / allotted them for an inheritance by line, / and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. |</verse>
    <verse value="56"> Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, / and didn't keep his testimonies; |</verse>
    <verse value="57"> but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. / They were turned aside like a deceitful bow. |</verse>
    <verse value="58"> For they provoked him to anger with their high places, / and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images. |</verse>
    <verse value="59"> When God heard this, he was angry, / and greatly abhorred Israel; |</verse>
    <verse value="60"> So that he forsook the tent of Shiloh, / the tent which he placed among men; |</verse>
    <verse value="61"> and delivered his strength into captivity, / his glory into the adversary's hand. |</verse>
    <verse value="62"> He also gave his people over to the sword, / and was angry with his inheritance. |</verse>
    <verse value="63"> Fire devoured their young men. / Their virgins had no wedding song. |</verse>
    <verse value="64"> Their priests fell by the sword, / and their widows couldn't weep. |</verse>
    <verse value="65"> Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, / like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine. |</verse>
    <verse value="66"> He struck his adversaries backward. / He put them to a perpetual reproach. |</verse>
    <verse value="67"> Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, / and didn't choose the tribe of Ephraim, |</verse>
    <verse value="68"> But chose the tribe of Judah, / Mount Zion which he loved. |</verse>
    <verse value="69"> He built his sanctuary like the heights, / like the earth which he has established forever. |</verse>
    <verse value="70"> He also chose David his servant, / and took him from the sheepfolds; |</verse>
    <verse value="71"> from following the ewes that have their young, / he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people, / and Israel, his inheritance. |</verse>
    <verse value="72"> So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, / and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands. |</verse>
