    <verse value="1">"Isn't a man forced to labor on earth? / Aren't his days like the days of a hired hand? |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow, / as a hireling who looks for his wages, |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> so am I made to possess months of misery, / wearisome nights are appointed to me. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> When I lie down, I say, / 'When shall I arise, and the night be gone?' / I toss and turn until the dawning of the day. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust. / My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, / and are spent without hope. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Oh remember that my life is a breath. / My eye shall no more see good. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> The eye of him who sees me shall see me no more. / Your eyes shall be on me, but I shall not be. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away, / so he who goes down to Sheol {Sheol is the place of the dead.} shall come up no more. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> He shall return no more to his house, / neither shall his place know him any more. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> "Therefore I will not keep silent. / I will speak in the anguish of my spirit. / I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Am I a sea, or a sea monster, / that you put a guard over me? |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> When I say, 'My bed shall comfort me. / My couch shall ease my complaint;' |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> then you scare me with dreams, / and terrify me through visions: |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> so that my soul chooses strangling, / death rather than my bones. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> I loathe my life. / I don't want to live forever. / Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> What is man, that you should magnify him, / that you should set your mind on him, |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> that you should visit him every morning, / and test him every moment? |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> How long will you not look away from me, / nor leave me alone until I swallow down my spittle? |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> If I have sinned, what do I do to you, you watcher of men? / Why have you set me as a mark for you, / so that I am a burden to myself? |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Why do you not pardon my disobedience, and take away my iniquity? / For now shall I lie down in the dust. / You will seek me diligently, but I shall not be." |</verse>
