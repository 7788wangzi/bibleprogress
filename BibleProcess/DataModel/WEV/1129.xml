    <verse value="1">I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts;</verse>
    <verse value="4"> and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Be diligent to come to me soon,</verse>
    <verse value="10"> for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his works,</verse>
    <verse value="15"> of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen. |</verse>
