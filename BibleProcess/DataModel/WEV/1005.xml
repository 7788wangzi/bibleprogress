    <verse value="1">but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Now very early in the morning, he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him. He sat down, and taught them.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery. Having set her in the midst,</verse>
    <verse value="4"> they told him, "Teacher, we found this woman in adultery, in the very act.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Now in our law, Moses commanded us to stone such. {Leviticus 20:10; Deuteronomy 22:22} What then do you say about her?"</verse>
    <verse value="6"> They said this testing him, that they might have something to accuse him of. | But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> But when they continued asking him, he looked up and said to them, "He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her."</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> They, when they heard it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning from the oldest, even to the last. Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was, in the middle.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Jesus, standing up, saw her and said, "Woman, where are your accusers? Did no one condemn you?" |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> She said, "No one, Lord." | Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you. Go your way. From now on, sin no more." |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Again, therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying, "I am the light of the world. {Isaiah 60:1} He who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life." |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> The Pharisees therefore said to him, "You testify about yourself. Your testimony is not valid." |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Jesus answered them, "Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you don't know where I came from, or where I am going.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> You judge according to the flesh. I judge no one.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> It's also written in your law that the testimony of two people is valid. {Deuteronomy 17:6; 19:15}</verse>
    <verse value="18"> I am one who testifies about myself, and the Father who sent me testifies about me." |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> They said therefore to him, "Where is your Father?" | Jesus answered, "You know neither me, nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also."</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, as he taught in the temple. Yet no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Jesus said therefore again to them, "I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sins. Where I go, you can't come." |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> The Jews therefore said, "Will he kill himself, that he says, 'Where I am going, you can't come?'" |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> He said to them, "You are from beneath. I am from above. You are of this world. I am not of this world.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> I said therefore to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am {or, I AM} he, you will die in your sins." |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> They said therefore to him, "Who are you?" | Jesus said to them, "Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you. However he who sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these I say to the world." |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> They didn't understand that he spoke to them about the Father.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Jesus therefore said to them, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and I do nothing of myself, but as my Father taught me, I say these things.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> He who sent me is with me. The Father hasn't left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to him." |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> As he spoke these things, many believed in him.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> Jesus therefore said to those Jews who had believed him, "If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free." {Psalm 119:45} |</verse>
    <verse value="33"> They answered him, "We are Abraham's seed, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How do you say, 'You will be made free?'" |</verse>
    <verse value="34"> Jesus answered them, "Most certainly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is the bondservant of sin.</verse>
    <verse value="35"> A bondservant doesn't live in the house forever. A son remains forever.</verse>
    <verse value="36"> If therefore the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.</verse>
    <verse value="37"> I know that you are Abraham's seed, yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you.</verse>
    <verse value="38"> I say the things which I have seen with my Father; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father." |</verse>
    <verse value="39"> They answered him, "Our father is Abraham." | Jesus said to them, "If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.</verse>
    <verse value="40"> But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham didn't do this.</verse>
    <verse value="41"> You do the works of your father." | They said to him, "We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father, God." |</verse>
    <verse value="42"> Therefore Jesus said to them, "If God were your father, you would love me, for I came out and have come from God. For I haven't come of myself, but he sent me.</verse>
    <verse value="43"> Why don't you understand my speech? Because you can't hear my word.</verse>
    <verse value="44"> You are of your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and doesn't stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a liar, and its father.</verse>
    <verse value="45"> But because I tell the truth, you don't believe me.</verse>
    <verse value="46"> Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?</verse>
    <verse value="47"> He who is of God hears the words of God. For this cause you don't hear, because you are not of God." |</verse>
    <verse value="48"> Then the Jews answered him, "Don't we say well that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?" |</verse>
    <verse value="49"> Jesus answered, "I don't have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.</verse>
    <verse value="50"> But I don't seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges.</verse>
    <verse value="51"> Most certainly, I tell you, if a person keeps my word, he will never see death." |</verse>
    <verse value="52"> Then the Jews said to him, "Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and you say, 'If a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death.'</verse>
    <verse value="53"> Are you greater than our father, Abraham, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to be?" |</verse>
    <verse value="54"> Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our God.</verse>
    <verse value="55"> You have not known him, but I know him. If I said, 'I don't know him,' I would be like you, a liar. But I know him, and keep his word.</verse>
    <verse value="56"> Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day. He saw it, and was glad." |</verse>
    <verse value="57"> The Jews therefore said to him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?" |</verse>
    <verse value="58"> Jesus said to them, "Most certainly, I tell you, before Abraham came into existence, I AM. {or, I am}" |</verse>
    <verse value="59"> Therefore they took up stones to throw at him, but Jesus was hidden, and went out of the temple, having gone through their midst, and so passed by. |</verse>
