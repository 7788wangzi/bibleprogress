    <verse value="1">After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Job answered:  |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> "Let the day perish in which I was born, / the night which said, 'There is a boy conceived.' |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Let that day be darkness. / Don't let God from above seek for it, / neither let the light shine on it. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own. / Let a cloud dwell on it. / Let all that makes black the day terrify it. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it. / Let it not rejoice among the days of the year. / Let it not come into the number of the months. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Behold, let that night be barren. / Let no joyful voice come therein. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Let them curse it who curse the day, / who are ready to rouse up leviathan. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Let the stars of its twilight be dark. / Let it look for light, but have none, / neither let it see the eyelids of the morning, |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> because it didn't shut up the doors of my mother's womb, / nor did it hide trouble from my eyes. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> "Why didn't I die from the womb? / Why didn't I give up the spirit when my mother bore me? |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Why did the knees receive me? / Or why the breast, that I should nurse? |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> For now should I have lain down and been quiet. / I should have slept, then I would have been at rest, |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> with kings and counselors of the earth, / who built up waste places for themselves; |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> or with princes who had gold, / who filled their houses with silver: |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, / as infants who never saw light. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> There the wicked cease from troubling. / There the weary are at rest. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> There the prisoners are at ease together. / They don't hear the voice of the taskmaster. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> The small and the great are there. / The servant is free from his master. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> "Why is light given to him who is in misery, / life to the bitter in soul, |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Who long for death, but it doesn't come; / and dig for it more than for hidden treasures, |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> who rejoice exceedingly, / and are glad, when they can find the grave? |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, / whom God has hedged in? |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> For my sighing comes before I eat. / My groanings are poured out like water. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> For the thing which I fear comes on me, / That which I am afraid of comes to me. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest; / but trouble comes." |</verse>
