    <verse value="1">A Psalm. A song for the Sabbath day. | It is a good thing to give thanks to Yahweh, / to sing praises to your name, Most High; |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> to proclaim your loving kindness in the morning, / and your faithfulness every night, |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> with the ten-stringed lute, with the harp, / and with the melody of the lyre. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> For you, Yahweh, have made me glad through your work. / I will triumph in the works of your hands. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> How great are your works, Yahweh! / Your thoughts are very deep. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> A senseless man doesn't know, / neither does a fool understand this: |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> though the wicked spring up as the grass, / and all the evildoers flourish, / they will be destroyed forever. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> But you, Yahweh, are on high forevermore. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> For, behold, your enemies, Yahweh, / for, behold, your enemies shall perish. / All the evildoers will be scattered. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox. / I am anointed with fresh oil. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> My eye has also seen my enemies. / My ears have heard of the wicked enemies who rise up against me. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree. / He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> They are planted in Yahweh's house. / They will flourish in our God's courts. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> They will still bring forth fruit in old age. / They will be full of sap and green, /</verse>
    <verse value="15"> to show that Yahweh is upright. | He is my rock, / and there is no unrighteousness in him. |</verse>
