    <verse value="1">You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> You therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn't crowned unless he has competed by the rules.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> The farmers who labor must be the first to get a share of the crops.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my Good News,</verse>
    <verse value="9"> in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God's word isn't chained.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones' sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> This saying is faithful: | "For if we died with him, / we will also live with him. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> If we endure, / we will also reign with him. | If we deny him, / he also will deny us. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> If we are faithless, / he remains faithful. / He can't deny himself." |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they don't argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn't need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness,</verse>
    <verse value="17"> and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</verse>
    <verse value="18"> men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> However God's firm foundation stands, having this seal, "The Lord knows those who are his," {Numbers 16:5} and, "Let every one who names the name of the Lord {TR reads "Christ" instead of "the Lord"} depart from unrighteousness."</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor, and some for dishonor.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master's use, prepared for every good work. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> The Lord's servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient,</verse>
    <verse value="25"> in gentleness correcting those who oppose him: perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,</verse>
    <verse value="26"> and they may recover themselves out of the devil's snare, having been taken captive by him to his will. |</verse>
