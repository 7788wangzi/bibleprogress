    <verse value="1">Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them, saying,</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son,</verse>
    <verse value="3"> and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast, but they would not come.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Again he sent out other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, "Behold, I have prepared my dinner. My cattle and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the marriage feast!"'</verse>
    <verse value="5"> But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise,</verse>
    <verse value="6"> and the rest grabbed his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> When the king heard that, he was angry, and sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> "Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding is ready, but those who were invited weren't worthy.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Go therefore to the intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to the marriage feast.'</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good. The wedding was filled with guests.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who didn't have on wedding clothing,</verse>
    <verse value="12"> and he said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing?' He was speechless.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Then the king said to the servants, 'Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and throw him into the outer darkness; there is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.'</verse>
    <verse value="14"> For many are called, but few chosen." |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are honest, and teach the way of God in truth, no matter whom you teach, for you aren't partial to anyone.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Tell us therefore, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?" |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, "Why do you test me, you hypocrites?</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Show me the tax money." | They brought to him a denarius. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> He asked them, "Whose is this image and inscription?" |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> They said to him, "Caesar's." | Then he said to them, "Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> When they heard it, they marveled, and left him, and went away. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> On that day Sadducees (those who say that there is no resurrection) came to him. They asked him,</verse>
    <verse value="24"> saying, "Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed for his brother.'</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Now there were with us seven brothers. The first married and died, and having no seed left his wife to his brother.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> In the same way, the second also, and the third, to the seventh.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> After them all, the woman died.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> In the resurrection therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her." |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> But Jesus answered them, "You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like God's angels in heaven.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> But concerning the resurrection of the dead, haven't you read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,</verse>
    <verse value="32"> 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?' {Exodus 3:6} God is not the God of the dead, but of the living." |</verse>
    <verse value="33"> When the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered themselves together.</verse>
    <verse value="35"> One of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, testing him.</verse>
    <verse value="36"> "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?" |</verse>
    <verse value="37"> Jesus said to him, "'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.' {Deuteronomy 6:5}</verse>
    <verse value="38"> This is the first and great commandment.</verse>
    <verse value="39"> A second likewise is this, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' {Leviticus 19:18}</verse>
    <verse value="40"> The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments." |</verse>
    <verse value="41"> Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,</verse>
    <verse value="42"> saying, "What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?" | They said to him, "Of David." |</verse>
    <verse value="43"> He said to them, "How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying, |</verse>
    <verse value="44"> 'The Lord said to my Lord, / sit on my right hand, / until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet?' {Psalm 110:1} |</verse>
    <verse value="45"> "If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?" |</verse>
    <verse value="46"> No one was able to answer him a word, neither did any man dare ask him any more questions from that day forth. |</verse>
