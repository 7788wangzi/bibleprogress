    <verse value="1">Israel, return to Yahweh your God; / for you have fallen because of your sin. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Take words with you, and return to Yahweh. / Tell him, "Forgive all our sins, / and accept that which is good: / so we offer our lips like bulls. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Assyria can't save us. / We won't ride on horses; / neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, 'Our gods!' / for in you the fatherless finds mercy." |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> "I will heal their waywardness. / I will love them freely; / for my anger is turned away from him. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> I will be like the dew to Israel. / He will blossom like the lily, / and send down his roots like Lebanon. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> His branches will spread, / and his beauty will be like the olive tree, / and his fragrance like Lebanon. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Men will dwell in his shade. / They will revive like the grain, / and blossom like the vine. / Their fragrance will be like the wine of Lebanon. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Ephraim, what have I to do any more with idols? / I answer, and will take care of him. / I am like a green fir tree; / from me your fruit is found." |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Who is wise, that he may understand these things? / Who is prudent, that he may know them? / For the ways of Yahweh are right, / and the righteous walk in them; / But the rebellious stumble in them. |</verse>
