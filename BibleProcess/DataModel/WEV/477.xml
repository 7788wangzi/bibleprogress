    <verse value="1">"Can you draw out Leviathan {Leviathan is a name for a crocodile or similar creature.} with a fishhook, / or press down his tongue with a cord? |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Can you put a rope into his nose, / or pierce his jaw through with a hook? |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Will he make many petitions to you, / or will he speak soft words to you? |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Will he make a covenant with you, / that you should take him for a servant forever? |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Will you play with him as with a bird? / Or will you bind him for your girls? |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Will traders barter for him? / Will they part him among the merchants? |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Can you fill his skin with barbed irons, / or his head with fish spears? |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Lay your hand on him. / Remember the battle, and do so no more. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Behold, the hope of him is in vain. / Won't one be cast down even at the sight of him? |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> None is so fierce that he dare stir him up. / Who then is he who can stand before me? |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Who has first given to me, that I should repay him? / Everything under the heavens is mine. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> "I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, / nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Who can strip off his outer garment? / Who shall come within his jaws? |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Who can open the doors of his face? / Around his teeth is terror. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Strong scales are his pride, / shut up together with a close seal. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> One is so near to another, / that no air can come between them. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> They are joined one to another. / They stick together, so that they can't be pulled apart. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> His sneezing flashes out light. / His eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Out of his mouth go burning torches. / Sparks of fire leap forth. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Out of his nostrils a smoke goes, / as of a boiling pot over a fire of reeds. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> His breath kindles coals. / A flame goes forth from his mouth. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> There is strength in his neck. / Terror dances before him. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> The flakes of his flesh are joined together. / They are firm on him. / They can't be moved. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> His heart is as firm as a stone, / yes, firm as the lower millstone. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid. / They retreat before his thrashing. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> If one attacks him with the sword, it can't prevail; / nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> He counts iron as straw; / and brass as rotten wood. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> The arrow can't make him flee. / Sling stones are like chaff to him. |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Clubs are counted as stubble. / He laughs at the rushing of the javelin. |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> His undersides are like sharp potsherds, / leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge. |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> He makes the deep to boil like a pot. / He makes the sea like a pot of ointment. |</verse>
    <verse value="32"> He makes a path shine after him. / One would think the deep had white hair. |</verse>
    <verse value="33"> On earth there is not his equal, / that is made without fear. |</verse>
    <verse value="34"> He sees everything that is high. / He is king over all the sons of pride." |</verse>
