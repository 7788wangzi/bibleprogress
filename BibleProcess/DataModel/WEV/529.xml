    <verse value="2"> Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity. / Cleanse me from my sin. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For I know my transgressions. / My sin is constantly before me. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Against you, and you only, have I sinned, / and done that which is evil in your sight; | that you may be proved right when you speak, / and justified when you judge. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity. / In sin my mother conceived me. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Behold, you desire truth in the inward parts. / You teach me wisdom in the inmost place. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean. / Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Let me hear joy and gladness, / That the bones which you have broken may rejoice. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Hide your face from my sins, / and blot out all of my iniquities. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Create in me a clean heart, O God. / Renew a right spirit within me. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Don't throw me from your presence, / and don't take your holy Spirit from me. |</verse>

    <verse value="15"> Lord, open my lips. / My mouth shall declare your praise. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> For you don't delight in sacrifice, or else I would give it. / You have no pleasure in burnt offering. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit. / A broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Do well in your good pleasure to Zion. / Build the walls of Jerusalem. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Then you will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, / in burnt offerings and in whole burnt offerings. | Then they will offer bulls on your altar. |</verse>
