    <verse value="1">Thus says Yahweh: | "For three transgressions of Moab, yes, for four, / I will not turn away its punishment; / because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime; |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> but I will send a fire on Moab, / and it will devour the palaces of Kerioth; / and Moab will die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet; |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> and I will cut off the judge from their midst, / and will kill all its princes with him," / says Yahweh. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Thus says Yahweh: | "For three transgressions of Judah, yes, for four, / I will not turn away its punishment; / because they have rejected Yahweh's law, / and have not kept his statutes, / and their lies have led them astray, / after which their fathers walked; |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> But I will send a fire on Judah, / and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem." |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Thus says Yahweh: | "For three transgressions of Israel, yes, for four, / I will not turn away its punishment; / because they have sold the righteous for silver, / and the needy for a pair of shoes; /</verse>
    <verse value="7"> They trample on the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, / and deny justice to the oppressed; / and a man and his father use the same maiden, to profane my holy name; /</verse>
    <verse value="8"> and they lay themselves down beside every altar on clothes taken in pledge; / and in the house of their God {The Hebrew word rendered "God" is "Elohim."} they drink the wine of those who have been fined. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, / whose height was like the height of the cedars, / and he was strong as the oaks; / yet I destroyed his fruit from above, / and his roots from beneath. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, / and led you forty years in the wilderness, / to possess the land of the Amorite. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> I raised up some of your sons for prophets, / and some of your young men for Nazirites. | Isn't this true, / you children of Israel?" says Yahweh. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> "But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink, / and commanded the prophets, saying, 'Don't prophesy!' |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Behold, I will crush you in your place, / as a cart crushes that is full of grain. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Flight will perish from the swift; / and the strong won't strengthen his force; / neither shall the mighty deliver himself; /</verse>
    <verse value="15"> neither shall he stand who handles the bow; / and he who is swift of foot won't escape; / neither shall he who rides the horse deliver himself; |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> and he who is courageous among the mighty will flee away naked on that day," / says Yahweh. |</verse>
