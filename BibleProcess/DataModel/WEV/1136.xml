    <verse value="1">Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus;</verse>
    <verse value="2"> who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who built the house has more honor than the house.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken,</verse>
    <verse value="6"> but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house; whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says,  | "Today if you will hear his voice, |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> don't harden your hearts, as in the rebellion, / like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness, |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> where your fathers tested me by proving me, / and saw my works for forty years. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Therefore I was displeased with that generation, / and said, 'They always err in their heart, / but they didn't know my ways;' |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> as I swore in my wrath, / 'They will not enter into my rest.'" {Psalm 95:7-11} |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;</verse>
    <verse value="13"> but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called "today"; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end:</verse>
    <verse value="15"> while it is said, | "Today if you will hear his voice, / don't harden your hearts, as in the rebellion." {Psalm 95:7-8} |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> For who, when they heard, rebelled? No, didn't all those who came out of Egypt by Moses?</verse>
    <verse value="17"> With whom was he displeased forty years? Wasn't it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?</verse>
    <verse value="18"> To whom did he swear that they wouldn't enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient?</verse>
    <verse value="19"> We see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief. |</verse>
