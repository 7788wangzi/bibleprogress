    <verse value="1">A Psalm by David, for a memorial. | Yahweh, don't rebuke me in your wrath, / neither chasten me in your hot displeasure. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> For your arrows have pierced me, / your hand presses hard on me. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation, / neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> For my iniquities have gone over my head. / As a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> My wounds are loathsome and corrupt, / because of my foolishness. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> I am pained and bowed down greatly. / I go mourning all day long. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> For my waist is filled with burning. / There is no soundness in my flesh. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> I am faint and severely bruised. / I have groaned by reason of the anguish of my heart. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Lord, all my desire is before you. / My groaning is not hidden from you. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> My heart throbs. / My strength fails me. / As for the light of my eyes, it has also left me. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague. / My kinsmen stand far away. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> They also who seek after my life lay snares. / Those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things, / and meditate deceits all day long. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> But I, as a deaf man, don't hear. / I am as a mute man who doesn't open his mouth. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Yes, I am as a man who doesn't hear, / in whose mouth are no reproofs. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> For in you, Yahweh, do I hope. / You will answer, Lord my God. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> For I said, "Don't let them gloat over me, / or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips." |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> For I am ready to fall. / My pain is continually before me. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> For I will declare my iniquity. / I will be sorry for my sin. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> But my enemies are vigorous and many. / Those who hate me without reason are numerous. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> They who also render evil for good are adversaries to me, / because I follow what is good. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Don't forsake me, Yahweh. / My God, don't be far from me. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Hurry to help me, / Lord, my salvation. |</verse>
