    <verse value="1">My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor, / if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger; |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> You are trapped by the words of your mouth. / You are ensnared with the words of your mouth. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, / since you have come into the hand of your neighbor. | Go, humble yourself. / Press your plea with your neighbor. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Give no sleep to your eyes, / nor slumber to your eyelids. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, / like a bird from the snare of the fowler. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Go to the ant, you sluggard. / Consider her ways, and be wise; |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> which having no chief, overseer, or ruler, /</verse>
    <verse value="8"> provides her bread in the summer, / and gathers her food in the harvest. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> How long will you sleep, sluggard? / When will you arise out of your sleep? |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> A little sleep, a little slumber, / a little folding of the hands to sleep: |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> so your poverty will come as a robber, / and your scarcity as an armed man. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> A worthless person, a man of iniquity, / is he who walks with a perverse mouth; |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet, / who motions with his fingers; |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> in whose heart is perverseness, / who devises evil continually, / who always sows discord. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Therefore his calamity will come suddenly. / He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> There are six things which Yahweh hates; / yes, seven which are an abomination to him: |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> haughty eyes, a lying tongue, / hands that shed innocent blood; |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> a heart that devises wicked schemes, / feet that are swift in running to mischief, |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> a false witness who utters lies, / and he who sows discord among brothers. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> My son, keep your father's commandment, / and don't forsake your mother's teaching. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Bind them continually on your heart. / Tie them around your neck. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> When you walk, it will lead you. / When you sleep, it will watch over you. / When you awake, it will talk with you. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> For the commandment is a lamp, / and the law is light. / Reproofs of instruction are the way of life, |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> to keep you from the immoral woman, / from the flattery of the wayward wife's tongue. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Don't lust after her beauty in your heart, / neither let her captivate you with her eyelids. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread. / The adulteress hunts for your precious life. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Can a man scoop fire into his lap, / and his clothes not be burned? |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Or can one walk on hot coals, / and his feet not be scorched? |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife. / Whoever touches her will not be unpunished. |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Men don't despise a thief, / if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry: |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> but if he is found, he shall restore seven times. / He shall give all the wealth of his house. |</verse>
    <verse value="32"> He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding. / He who does it destroys his own soul. |</verse>
    <verse value="33"> He will get wounds and dishonor. / His reproach will not be wiped away. |</verse>
    <verse value="34"> For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband. / He won't spare in the day of vengeance. |</verse>
    <verse value="35"> He won't regard any ransom, / neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts. |</verse>
