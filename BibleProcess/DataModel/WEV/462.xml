    <verse value="1">Then Job answered, |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "How have you helped him who is without power! / How have you saved the arm that has no strength! |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> How have you counseled him who has no wisdom, / and plentifully declared sound knowledge! |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> To whom have you uttered words? / Whose spirit came forth from you? |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> "Those who are deceased tremble, / those beneath the waters and all that live in them. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Sheol {Sheol is the lower world or the grave.} is naked before God, / and Abaddon {Abaddon means Destroyer.} has no covering. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> He stretches out the north over empty space, / and hangs the earth on nothing. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, / and the cloud is not burst under them. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> He encloses the face of his throne, / and spreads his cloud on it. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> He has described a boundary on the surface of the waters, / and to the confines of light and darkness. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> The pillars of heaven tremble / and are astonished at his rebuke. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> He stirs up the sea with his power, / and by his understanding he strikes through Rahab. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> By his Spirit the heavens are garnished. / His hand has pierced the swift serpent. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways. / How small a whisper do we hear of him! / But the thunder of his power who can understand?" |</verse>
