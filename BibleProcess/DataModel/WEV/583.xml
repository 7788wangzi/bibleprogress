    <verse value="10"> and confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute; / to Israel for an everlasting covenant, |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan, / the lot of your inheritance"; |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> when they were but a few men in number, / yes, very few, and foreigners in it. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> They went about from nation to nation, / from one kingdom to another people. |</verse>

    <verse value="18"> They bruised his feet with shackles. / His neck was locked in irons, |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> until the time that his word happened, / and Yahweh's word proved him true. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> The king sent and freed him; / even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> He made him lord of his house, / and ruler of all of his possessions; |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> to discipline his princes at his pleasure, / and to teach his elders wisdom. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Israel also came into Egypt. / Jacob lived in the land of Ham. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> He increased his people greatly, / and made them stronger than their adversaries. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> He turned their heart to hate his people, / to conspire against his servants. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> He sent Moses, his servant, / and Aaron, whom he had chosen. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> They performed miracles among them, / and wonders in the land of Ham. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> He sent darkness, and made it dark. / They didn't rebel against his words. |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> He turned their waters into blood, / and killed their fish. |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Their land swarmed with frogs, / even in the rooms of their kings. |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> He spoke, and swarms of flies came, / and lice in all their borders. |</verse>
    <verse value="32"> He gave them hail for rain, / with lightning in their land. |</verse>
    <verse value="33"> He struck their vines and also their fig trees, / and shattered the trees of their country. |</verse>
    <verse value="34"> He spoke, and the locusts came, / and the grasshoppers, without number, |</verse>
    <verse value="35"> ate up every plant in their land; / and ate up the fruit of their ground. |</verse>
    <verse value="36"> He struck also all the firstborn in their land, / the first fruits of all their manhood. |</verse>
    <verse value="37"> He brought them forth with silver and gold. / There was not one feeble person among his tribes. |</verse>
    <verse value="38"> Egypt was glad when they departed, / for the fear of them had fallen on them. |</verse>
    <verse value="39"> He spread a cloud for a covering, / fire to give light in the night. |</verse>
    <verse value="40"> They asked, and he brought quails, / and satisfied them with the bread of the sky. |</verse>
    <verse value="41"> He opened the rock, and waters gushed out. / They ran as a river in the dry places. |</verse>
    <verse value="42"> For he remembered his holy word, / and Abraham, his servant. |</verse>
    <verse value="43"> He brought forth his people with joy, / his chosen with singing. |</verse>
    <verse value="44"> He gave them the lands of the nations. / They took the labor of the peoples in possession, |</verse>
    <verse value="45"> that they might keep his statutes, / and observe his laws. / Praise Yah! |</verse>
