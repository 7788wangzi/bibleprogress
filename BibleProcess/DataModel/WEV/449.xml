    <verse value="1">"Behold, my eye has seen all this. / My ear has heard and understood it. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> What you know, I know also. / I am not inferior to you. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> "Surely I would speak to the Almighty. / I desire to reason with God. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> But you are forgers of lies. / You are all physicians of no value. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Oh that you would be completely silent! / Then you would be wise. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Hear now my reasoning. / Listen to the pleadings of my lips. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Will you speak unrighteously for God, / and talk deceitfully for him? |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Will you show partiality to him? / Will you contend for God? |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Is it good that he should search you out? / Or as one deceives a man, will you deceive him? |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> He will surely reprove you / if you secretly show partiality. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Shall not his majesty make you afraid, / And his dread fall on you? |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, / Your defenses are defenses of clay. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> "Be silent, leave me alone, that I may speak. / Let come on me what will. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Why should I take my flesh in my teeth, / and put my life in my hand? |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Behold, he will kill me. / I have no hope. / Nevertheless, I will maintain my ways before him. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> This also shall be my salvation, / that a godless man shall not come before him. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Hear diligently my speech. / Let my declaration be in your ears. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> See now, I have set my cause in order. / I know that I am righteous. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Who is he who will contend with me? / For then would I hold my peace and give up the spirit. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> "Only don't do two things to me; / then I will not hide myself from your face: |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> withdraw your hand far from me; / and don't let your terror make me afraid. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Then call, and I will answer; / or let me speak, and you answer me. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> How many are my iniquities and sins? / Make me know my disobedience and my sin. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Why hide you your face, / and hold me for your enemy? |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Will you harass a driven leaf? / Will you pursue the dry stubble? |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> For you write bitter things against me, / and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth: |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> You also put my feet in the stocks, / and mark all my paths. / You set a bound to the soles of my feet, |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> though I am decaying like a rotten thing, / like a garment that is moth-eaten. |</verse>
