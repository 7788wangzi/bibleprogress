    <verse value="2"> (and the life was revealed, and we have seen, and testify, and declare to you the life, the eternal life, which was with the Father, and was revealed to us);</verse>
    <verse value="3"> that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us. Yes, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son, Jesus Christ.</verse>

    <verse value="8"> If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</verse>

    <verse value="10"> If we say that we haven't sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. |</verse>
