    <verse value="1">David spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> and he said, | "Yahweh is my rock, / my fortress, / and my deliverer, even mine; |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> God, my rock, in him I will take refuge; / my shield, and the horn of my salvation, / my high tower, and my refuge. / My savior, you save me from violence. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> I will call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised: / So shall I be saved from my enemies. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> For the waves of death surrounded me. / The floods of ungodliness made me afraid. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> The cords of Sheol {Sheol is the place of the dead.} were around me. | The snares of death caught me. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> In my distress I called on Yahweh. / Yes, I called to my God. | He heard my voice out of his temple. / My cry came into his ears. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Then the earth shook and trembled. / The foundations of heaven quaked and were shaken, / because he was angry. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Smoke went up out of his nostrils. / Fire out of his mouth devoured. / Coals were kindled by it. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> He bowed the heavens also, and came down. / Thick darkness was under his feet. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> He rode on a cherub, and flew. / Yes, he was seen on the wings of the wind. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> He made darkness pavilions around himself: / gathering of waters, and thick clouds of the skies. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> At the brightness before him, / coals of fire were kindled. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Yahweh thundered from heaven. / The Most High uttered his voice. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> He sent out arrows, and scattered them; / lightning, and confused them. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Then the channels of the sea appeared. / The foundations of the world were laid bare by the rebuke of Yahweh, / At the blast of the breath of his nostrils. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> He sent from on high and he took me. / He drew me out of many waters. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> He delivered me from my strong enemy, / from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> They came on me in the day of my calamity, / but Yahweh was my support. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> He also brought me out into a large place. / He delivered me, because he delighted in me. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Yahweh rewarded me according to my righteousness. / He rewarded me according to the cleanness of my hands. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, / and have not wickedly departed from my God. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> For all his ordinances were before me. / As for his statutes, I did not depart from them. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> I was also perfect toward him. / I kept myself from my iniquity. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness, / According to my cleanness in his eyesight. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> With the merciful you will show yourself merciful. / With the perfect man you will show yourself perfect. /</verse>
    <verse value="27"> With the pure you will show yourself pure. / With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> You will save the afflicted people, / But your eyes are on the haughty, that you may bring them down. |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> For you are my lamp, Yahweh. / Yahweh will light up my darkness. |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> For by you, I run against a troop. | By my God, I leap over a wall. |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> As for God, his way is perfect. / The word of Yahweh is tested. / He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him. |</verse>
    <verse value="32"> For who is God, besides Yahweh? / Who is a rock, besides our God? |</verse>
    <verse value="33"> God is my strong fortress. / He makes my way perfect. |</verse>
    <verse value="34"> He makes his feet like hinds' feet, / and sets me on my high places. |</verse>
    <verse value="35"> He teaches my hands to war, / so that my arms bend a bow of brass. |</verse>
    <verse value="36"> You have also given me the shield of your salvation. / Your gentleness has made me great. |</verse>
    <verse value="37"> You have enlarged my steps under me. / My feet have not slipped. |</verse>
    <verse value="38"> I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them. / I didn't turn again until they were consumed. |</verse>
    <verse value="39"> I have consumed them, / and struck them through, / so that they can't arise. / Yes, they have fallen under my feet. |</verse>
    <verse value="40"> For you have armed me with strength for the battle. / You have subdued under me those who rose up against me. |</verse>
    <verse value="41"> You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, / that I might cut off those who hate me. |</verse>
    <verse value="42"> They looked, but there was none to save; / even to Yahweh, but he didn't answer them. |</verse>
    <verse value="43"> Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth. / I crushed them as the mire of the streets, and spread them abroad. |</verse>
    <verse value="44"> You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people. / You have kept me to be the head of the nations. / A people whom I have not known will serve me. |</verse>
    <verse value="45"> The foreigners will submit themselves to me. / As soon as they hear of me, they will obey me. |</verse>
    <verse value="46"> The foreigners will fade away, / and will come trembling out of their close places. |</verse>
    <verse value="47"> Yahweh lives! / Blessed be my rock! | Exalted be God, the rock of my salvation, /</verse>
    <verse value="48"> even the God who executes vengeance for me, / who brings down peoples under me, /</verse>
    <verse value="49"> who brings me away from my enemies. | Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me. / You deliver me from the violent man. |</verse>
    <verse value="50"> Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations. / Will sing praises to your name. |</verse>
    <verse value="51"> He gives great deliverance to his king, / and shows loving kindness to his anointed, / to David and to his seed, forevermore." |</verse>
