    <verse value="2"> It happened, as they traveled east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they lived there.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> They said one to another, "Come, let's make bricks, and burn them thoroughly." They had brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> They said, "Come, let's build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top reaches to the sky, and let's make ourselves a name, lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth." |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Yahweh said, "Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is what they begin to do. Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Come, let's go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another's speech."</verse>
    <verse value="8"> So Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth. They stopped building the city.</verse>
