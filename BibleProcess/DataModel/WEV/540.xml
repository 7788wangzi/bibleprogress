    <verse value="1">For the Chief Musician. To Jeduthan. A Psalm by David. | My soul rests in God alone. / My salvation is from him. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress-- / I will never be greatly shaken. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> How long will you assault a man, / would all of you throw him down, / Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence? |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> They fully intend to throw him down from his lofty place. / They delight in lies. / They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. | Selah. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> My soul, wait in silence for God alone, / for my expectation is from him. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress. / I will not be shaken. |</verse>

    <verse value="8"> Trust in him at all times, you people. / Pour out your heart before him. / God is a refuge for us. | Selah. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Surely men of low degree are just a breath, / and men of high degree are a lie. | In the balances they will go up. / They are together lighter than a breath. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Don't trust in oppression. / Don't become vain in robbery. | If riches increase, / don't set your heart on them. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> God has spoken once; / twice I have heard this, / that power belongs to God. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Also to you, Lord, belongs loving kindness, / for you reward every man according to his work. |</verse>
