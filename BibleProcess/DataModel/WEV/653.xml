    <verse value="1">These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> It is the glory of God to conceal a thing, / but the glory of kings is to search out a matter. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth, / so the hearts of kings are unsearchable. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Take away the dross from the silver, / and material comes out for the refiner; |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Take away the wicked from the king's presence, / and his throne will be established in righteousness. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Don't exalt yourself in the presence of the king, / or claim a place among great men; |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> for it is better that it be said to you, "Come up here," / than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince, / whom your eyes have seen. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Don't be hasty in bringing charges to court. / What will you do in the end when your neighbor shames you? /</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Debate your case with your neighbor, / and don't betray the confidence of another; /</verse>
    <verse value="10"> lest one who hears it put you to shame, / and your bad reputation never depart. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> A word fitly spoken / is like apples of gold in settings of silver. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, / so is a wise reprover to an obedient ear. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, / so is a faithful messenger to those who send him; / for he refreshes the soul of his masters. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> As clouds and wind without rain, / so is he who boasts of gifts deceptively. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> By patience a ruler is persuaded. / A soft tongue breaks the bone. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Have you found honey? / Eat as much as is sufficient for you, / lest you eat too much, and vomit it. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor's house, / lest he be weary of you, and hate you. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> A man who gives false testimony against his neighbor / is like a club, a sword, or a sharp arrow. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Confidence in someone unfaithful in time of trouble / is like a bad tooth, or a lame foot. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> As one who takes away a garment in cold weather, / or vinegar on soda, / so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat. / If he is thirsty, give him water to drink: |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> for you will heap coals of fire on his head, / and Yahweh will reward you. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> The north wind brings forth rain: / so a backbiting tongue brings an angry face. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, / than to share a house with a contentious woman. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Like cold water to a thirsty soul, / so is good news from a far country. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Like a muddied spring, and a polluted well, / so is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> It is not good to eat much honey; / nor is it honorable to seek one's own honor. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Like a city that is broken down and without walls / is a man whose spirit is without restraint. |</verse>
