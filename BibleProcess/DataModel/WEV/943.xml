    <verse value="1">At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,</verse>
    <verse value="2"> and said to his servants, "This is John the Baptizer. He is risen from the dead. That is why these powers work in him."</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For Herod had laid hold of John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> For John said to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."</verse>
    <verse value="5"> When he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased Herod.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> She, being prompted by her mother, said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptizer." |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths, and of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it to be given,</verse>
    <verse value="10"> and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> His head was brought on a platter, and given to the young lady: and she brought it to her mother.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> His disciples came, and took the body, and buried it; and they went and told Jesus.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat, to a deserted place apart. When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Jesus went out, and he saw a great multitude. He had compassion on them, and healed their sick.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> When evening had come, his disciples came to him, saying, "This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food." |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> But Jesus said to them, "They don't need to go away. You give them something to eat." |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> They told him, "We only have here five loaves and two fish." |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> He said, "Bring them here to me."</verse>
    <verse value="19"> He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> They all ate, and were filled. They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> After he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had come, he was there alone.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> In the fourth watch of the night, {The night was equally divided into four watches, so the fourth watch is approximately 3:00 A. M. to sunrise.} Jesus came to them, walking on the sea. {see Job 9:8}</verse>
    <verse value="26"> When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, "It's a ghost!" and they cried out for fear.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying "Cheer up! It is I! {or, I AM!} Don't be afraid." |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Peter answered him and said, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters." |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> He said, "Come!" | Peter stepped down from the boat, and walked on the waters to come to Jesus.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> But when he saw that the wind was strong, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!" |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"</verse>
    <verse value="32"> When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased.</verse>
    <verse value="33"> Those who were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying, "You are truly the Son of God!" |</verse>
    <verse value="34"> When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.</verse>
    <verse value="35"> When the people of that place recognized him, they sent into all that surrounding region, and brought to him all who were sick,</verse>
    <verse value="36"> and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe {or, tassel} of his garment. As many as touched it were made whole. |</verse>
