    <verse value="1">Why do the nations rage, / and the peoples plot a vain thing? |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> The kings of the earth take a stand, / and the rulers take counsel together, / against Yahweh, and against his Anointed, {The word "Anointed" is the same as the word for "Messiah" or "Christ"} saying, |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> "Let's break their bonds apart, / and cast their cords from us." |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> He who sits in the heavens will laugh. / The Lord {The word translated "Lord" is "Adonai."} will have them in derision. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Then he will speak to them in his anger, / and terrify them in his wrath: |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> "Yet I have set my King on my holy hill of Zion." /</verse>
    <verse value="7"> I will tell of the decree. | Yahweh said to me, "You are my son. / Today I have become your father. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance, / the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> You shall break them with a rod of iron. / You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel." |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Now therefore be wise, you kings. / Be instructed, you judges of the earth. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Serve Yahweh with fear, / and rejoice with trembling. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Give sincere homage to the Son {or, Kiss the son}, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, / for his wrath will soon be kindled. / Blessed are all those who take refuge in him. |</verse>
