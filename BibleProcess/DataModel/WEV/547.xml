    <verse value="1">For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Lilies." By David. | Save me, God, / for the waters have come up to my neck! |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold. / I have come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> I am weary with my crying. / My throat is dry. / My eyes fail, looking for my God. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head. / Those who want to cut me off, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty. / I have to restore what I didn't take away. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> God, you know my foolishness. / My sins aren't hidden from you. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Don't let those who wait for you be shamed through me, Lord Yahweh of Armies. / Don't let those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me, God of Israel. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Because for your sake, I have borne reproach. / Shame has covered my face. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> I have become a stranger to my brothers, / an alien to my mother's children. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> For the zeal of your house consumes me. / The reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> When I wept and I fasted, / that was to my reproach. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> When I made sackcloth my clothing, / I became a byword to them. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Those who sit in the gate talk about me. / I am the song of the drunkards. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> But as for me, my prayer is to you, Yahweh, in an acceptable time. / God, in the abundance of your loving kindness, answer me in the truth of your salvation. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Deliver me out of the mire, and don't let me sink. / Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Don't let the flood waters overwhelm me, / neither let the deep swallow me up. / Don't let the pit shut its mouth on me. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Answer me, Yahweh, for your loving kindness is good. / According to the multitude of your tender mercies, turn to me. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Don't hide your face from your servant, / for I am in distress. / Answer me speedily! |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Draw near to my soul, and redeem it. / Ransom me because of my enemies. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor. / My adversaries are all before you. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness. / I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; / for comforters, but I found none. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> They also gave me gall for my food. / In my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Let their table before them become a snare. / May it become a retribution and a trap. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Let their eyes be darkened, so that they can't see. / Let their backs be continually bent. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Pour out your indignation on them. / Let the fierceness of your anger overtake them. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Let their habitation be desolate. / Let no one dwell in their tents. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> For they persecute him whom you have wounded. / They tell of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Charge them with crime upon crime. / Don't let them come into your righteousness. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Let them be blotted out of the book of life, / and not be written with the righteous. |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> But I am in pain and distress. / Let your salvation, God, protect me. |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> I will praise the name of God with a song, / and will magnify him with thanksgiving. |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> It will please Yahweh better than an ox, / or a bull that has horns and hoofs. |</verse>
    <verse value="32"> The humble have seen it, and are glad. / You who seek after God, let your heart live. |</verse>
    <verse value="33"> For Yahweh hears the needy, / and doesn't despise his captive people. |</verse>
    <verse value="34"> Let heaven and earth praise him; / the seas, and everything that moves therein! |</verse>
    <verse value="35"> For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah. / They shall settle there, and own it. |</verse>
    <verse value="36"> The children also of his servants shall inherit it. / Those who love his name shall dwell therein. |</verse>
