    <verse value="1">As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?" |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Jesus answered, "Neither did this man sin, nor his parents; but, that the works of God might be revealed in him.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> I must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."</verse>
    <verse value="6"> When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man's eyes with the mud,</verse>
    <verse value="7"> and said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which means "Sent"). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind before, said, "Isn't this he who sat and begged?"</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Others were saying, "It is he." Still others were saying, "He looks like him." | He said, "I am he."</verse>
    <verse value="10"> They therefore were asking him, "How were your eyes opened?" |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> He answered, "A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, 'Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash.' So I went away and washed, and I received sight." |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Then they asked him, "Where is he?" | He said, "I don't know." |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, "He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see." |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Some therefore of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, because he doesn't keep the Sabbath." Others said, "How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?" There was division among them.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Therefore they asked the blind man again, "What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?" | He said, "He is a prophet." |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,</verse>
    <verse value="19"> and asked them, "Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?" |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> His parents answered them, "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;</verse>
    <verse value="21"> but how he now sees, we don't know; or who opened his eyes, we don't know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself."</verse>
    <verse value="22"> His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Therefore his parents said, "He is of age. Ask him." |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, "Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner." |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> He therefore answered, "I don't know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see." |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> They said to him again, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?" |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> He answered them, "I told you already, and you didn't listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don't also want to become his disciples, do you?" |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> They insulted him and said, "You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this man, we don't know where he comes from." |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> The man answered them, "How amazing! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> We know that God doesn't listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshipper of God, and does his will, he listens to him. {Psalm 66:18, Proverbs 15:29; 28:9}</verse>
    <verse value="32"> Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind.</verse>
    <verse value="33"> If this man were not from God, he could do nothing." |</verse>
    <verse value="34"> They answered him, "You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?" They threw him out. |</verse>
    <verse value="35"> Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, "Do you believe in the Son of God?" |</verse>
    <verse value="36"> He answered, "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?" |</verse>
    <verse value="37"> Jesus said to him, "You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you." |</verse>
    <verse value="38"> He said, "Lord, I believe!" and he worshiped him. |</verse>
    <verse value="39"> Jesus said, "I came into this world for judgment, that those who don't see may see; and that those who see may become blind." |</verse>
    <verse value="40"> Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, "Are we also blind?" |</verse>
    <verse value="41"> Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, 'We see.' Therefore your sin remains. |</verse>
