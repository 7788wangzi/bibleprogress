    <verse value="1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, / to the saints who are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ;</verse>
    <verse value="4"> even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and without blemish before him in love;</verse>
    <verse value="5"> having predestined us for adoption as children through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his desire,</verse>
    <verse value="6"> to the praise of the glory of his grace, by which he freely bestowed favor on us in the Beloved,</verse>
    <verse value="7"> in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,</verse>
    <verse value="8"> which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,</verse>
    <verse value="9"> making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him</verse>
    <verse value="10"> to an administration of the fullness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things on the earth, in him;</verse>
    <verse value="11"> in whom also we were assigned an inheritance, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will;</verse>
    <verse value="12"> to the end that we should be to the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ:</verse>
    <verse value="13"> in whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the Good News of your salvation--in whom, having also believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,</verse>
    <verse value="14"> who is a pledge of our inheritance, to the redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of his glory.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and the love which you have toward all the saints,</verse>
    <verse value="16"> don't cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,</verse>
    <verse value="17"> that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;</verse>
    <verse value="18"> having the eyes of your hearts {TR reads "understanding" instead of "hearts"} enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,</verse>
    <verse value="19"> and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might</verse>
    <verse value="20"> which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places,</verse>
    <verse value="21"> far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is to come.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> He put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things for the assembly,</verse>
    <verse value="23"> which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all. |</verse>
