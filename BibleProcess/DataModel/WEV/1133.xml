    <verse value="1">Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,</verse>
    <verse value="2"> to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,</verse>
    <verse value="5"> hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;</verse>
    <verse value="6"> that the fellowship of your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Therefore though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,</verse>
    <verse value="9"> yet for love's sake I rather beg, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> I beg you for my child, whom I have become the father of in my chains, Onesimus, {Onesimus means "useful."}</verse>
    <verse value="11"> who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> I am sending him back. Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,</verse>
    <verse value="13"> whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever,</verse>
    <verse value="16"> no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, put that to my account.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides).</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,</verse>
    <verse value="24"> as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. |</verse>
