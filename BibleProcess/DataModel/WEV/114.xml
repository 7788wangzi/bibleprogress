    <verse value="1">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Command the children of Israel, that they bring to you pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Outside of the veil of the Testimony, in the Tent of Meeting, shall Aaron keep it in order from evening to morning before Yahweh continually: it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> He shall keep in order the lamps on the pure gold lampstand before Yahweh continually. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> "You shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes of it: two tenth parts of an ephah {1 ephah is about 22 litres or about 2/3 of a bushel} shall be in one cake.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> You shall set them in two rows, six on a row, on the pure gold table before Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> You shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire to Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Every Sabbath day he shall set it in order before Yahweh continually. It is on the behalf of the children of Israel an everlasting covenant.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> It shall be for Aaron and his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place: for it is most holy to him of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire by a perpetual statute." |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> The son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him to Moses. His mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> They put him in custody, until the will of Yahweh should be declared to them. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
    <verse value="14"> "Bring out of the camp him who cursed; and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> He who blasphemes the name of Yahweh, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him: the foreigner as well as the native-born, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> "'He who strikes any man mortally shall surely be put to death.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> He who strikes an animal mortally shall make it good, life for life.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> If anyone injures his neighbor; as he has done, so shall it be done to him:</verse>
    <verse value="20"> fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he has injured someone, so shall it be done to him.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> He who kills an animal shall make it good; and he who kills a man shall be put to death.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> You shall have one kind of law, for the foreigner as well as the native-born: for I am Yahweh your God.'" |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and they brought out him who had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. The children of Israel did as Yahweh commanded Moses. |</verse>
