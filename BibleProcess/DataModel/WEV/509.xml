    <verse value="1">For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David. | In you, Yahweh, I take refuge. / Let me never be disappointed. / Deliver me in your righteousness. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Bow down your ear to me. / Deliver me speedily. | Be to me a strong rock, / a house of defense to save me. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For you are my rock and my fortress, / therefore for your name's sake lead me and guide me. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Pluck me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me, / for you are my stronghold. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Into your hand I commend my spirit. / You redeem me, Yahweh, God of truth. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> I hate those who regard lying vanities, / but I trust in Yahweh. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> I will be glad and rejoice in your loving kindness, / for you have seen my affliction. / You have known my soul in adversities. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> You have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy. / You have set my feet in a large place. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am in distress. / My eye, my soul, and my body waste away with grief. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> For my life is spent with sorrow, / my years with sighing. | My strength fails because of my iniquity. / My bones are wasted away. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Because of all my adversaries I have become utterly contemptible to my neighbors, / A fear to my acquaintances. / Those who saw me on the street fled from me. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> I am forgotten from their hearts like a dead man. / I am like broken pottery. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> For I have heard the slander of many, terror on every side, / while they conspire together against me, / they plot to take away my life. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> But I trust in you, Yahweh. / I said, "You are my God." |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> My times are in your hand. / Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, and from those who persecute me. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Make your face to shine on your servant. / Save me in your loving kindness. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Let me not be disappointed, Yahweh, for I have called on you. / Let the wicked be disappointed. / Let them be silent in Sheol {Sheol is the place of the dead.}. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Let the lying lips be mute, / which speak against the righteous insolently, with pride and contempt. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Oh how great is your goodness, / which you have laid up for those who fear you, / which you have worked for those who take refuge in you, / before the sons of men! |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> In the shelter of your presence you will hide them from the plotting of man. / You will keep them secretly in a dwelling away from the strife of tongues. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Praise be to Yahweh, / for he has shown me his marvelous loving kindness in a strong city. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> As for me, I said in my haste, "I am cut off from before your eyes." / Nevertheless you heard the voice of my petitions when I cried to you. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Oh love Yahweh, all you his saints! / Yahweh preserves the faithful, | and fully recompenses him who behaves arrogantly. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Be strong, and let your heart take courage, / all you who hope in Yahweh. |</verse>
