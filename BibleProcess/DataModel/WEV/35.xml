    <verse value="1">God said to Jacob, "Arise, go up to Bethel, and live there. Make there an altar to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother." |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Then Jacob said to his household, and to all who were with him, "Put away the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, change your garments.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Let us arise, and go up to Bethel. I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went." |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> They gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> They traveled, and a terror of God was on the cities that were around them, and they didn't pursue the sons of Jacob.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> He built an altar there, and called the place El Beth El; because there God was revealed to him, when he fled from the face of his brother.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; and its name was called Allon Bacuth. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan Aram, and blessed him.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> God said to him, "Your name is Jacob. Your name shall not be Jacob any more, but your name will be Israel." He named him Israel.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> God said to him, "I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations will be from you, and kings will come out of your body.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to you, and to your seed after you will I give the land." |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> God went up from him in the place where he spoke with him.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him "Bethel." |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> They traveled from Bethel. There was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and Rachel travailed. She had hard labor.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> When she was in hard labor, the midwife said to her, "Don't be afraid, for now you will have another son." |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> It happened, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she named him Benoni, {"Benoni" means "son of my trouble."} but his father named him Benjamin. {"Benjamin" means "son of my right hand."}</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem).</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Jacob set up a pillar on her grave. The same is the Pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Israel traveled, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> It happened, while Israel lived in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father's concubine, and Israel heard of it. | Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob's firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> The sons of Bilhah (Rachel's handmaid): Dan and Naphtali.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> The sons of Zilpah (Leah's handmaid): Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Jacob came to Isaac his father, to Mamre, to Kiriath Arba (which is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac lived as foreigners. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> The days of Isaac were one hundred eighty years.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Isaac gave up the spirit, and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. Esau and Jacob, his sons, buried him. |</verse>
