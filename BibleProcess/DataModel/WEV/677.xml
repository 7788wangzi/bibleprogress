    <verse value="4"> You are beautiful, my love, as Tirzah, / lovely as Jerusalem, / awesome as an army with banners. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Turn away your eyes from me, / for they have overcome me. | Your hair is like a flock of goats, / that lie along the side of Gilead. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Your teeth are like a flock of ewes, / which have come up from the washing; / of which every one has twins; / none is bereaved among them. |</verse>
