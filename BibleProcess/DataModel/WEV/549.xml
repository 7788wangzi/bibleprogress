    <verse value="4"> Rescue me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, / from the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man. |</verse>

    <verse value="9"> Don't reject me in my old age. / Don't forsake me when my strength fails. |</verse>

    <verse value="12"> God, don't be far from me. / My God, hurry to help me. |</verse>

    <verse value="14"> But I will always hope, / and will add to all of your praise. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> My mouth will tell about your righteousness, / and of your salvation all day, / though I don't know its full measure. |</verse>

    <verse value="18"> Yes, even when I am old and gray-haired, God, don't forsake me, / until I have declared your strength to the next generation, / your might to everyone who is to come. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Your righteousness also, God, reaches to the heavens; / you have done great things. / God, who is like you? |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> You, who have shown us many and bitter troubles, / you will let me live. / You will bring us up again from the depths of the earth. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Increase my honor, / and comfort me again. |</verse>

    <verse value="24"> My tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long, / for they are disappointed, and they are confounded, / who want to harm me. |</verse>
