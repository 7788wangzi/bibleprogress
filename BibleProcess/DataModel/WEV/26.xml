    <verse value="1">There was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Yahweh appeared to him, and said, "Don't go down into Egypt. Live in the land I will tell you about.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Live in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you. For to you, and to your seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and will give to your seed all these lands. In your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed,</verse>
    <verse value="5"> because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my requirements, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws." |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Isaac lived in Gerar.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> The men of the place asked him about his wife. He said, "She is my sister," for he was afraid to say, "My wife," lest, he thought, "the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to look at."</verse>
    <verse value="8"> It happened, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Abimelech called Isaac, and said, "Behold, surely she is your wife. Why did you say, 'She is my sister?'" | Isaac said to him, "Because I said, 'Lest I die because of her.'" |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Abimelech said, "What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!" |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Abimelech commanded all the people, saying, "He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death." |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted. Yahweh blessed him.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> The man grew great, and grew more and more until he became very great.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> He had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds, and a great household. The Philistines envied him.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Now all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Abimelech said to Isaac, "Go from us, for you are much mightier than we." |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Isaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived there. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father. For the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. He called their names after the names by which his father had called them.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Isaac's servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> The herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, "The water is ours." He called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> They dug another well, and they argued over that, also. He called its name Sitnah.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> He left that place, and dug another well. They didn't argue over that one. He called it Rehoboth. He said, "For now Yahweh has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land." |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> He went up from there to Beersheba.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Yahweh appeared to him the same night, and said, "I am the God of Abraham your father. Don't be afraid, for I am with you, and will bless you, and multiply your seed for my servant Abraham's sake." |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> He built an altar there, and called on the name of Yahweh, and pitched his tent there. There Isaac's servants dug a well. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Isaac said to them, "Why have you come to me, since you hate me, and have sent me away from you?" |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> They said, "We saw plainly that Yahweh was with you. We said, 'Let there now be an oath between us, even between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you,</verse>
    <verse value="29"> that you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace.' You are now the blessed of Yahweh." |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> He made them a feast, and they ate and drank.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> They rose up some time in the morning, and swore one to another. Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> It happened the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, "We have found water."</verse>
    <verse value="33"> He called it Shibah. {Shibah means "oath" or "seven."} Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba {Beersheba means "well of the oath" or "well of the seven"} to this day. |</verse>
    <verse value="34"> When Esau was forty years old, he took as wife Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite.</verse>
    <verse value="35"> They grieved Isaac's and Rebekah's spirits. |</verse>
