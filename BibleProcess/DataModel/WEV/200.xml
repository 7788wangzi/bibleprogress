    <verse value="1">Now Joshua was old and well advanced in years. Yahweh said to him, "You are old and advanced in years, and there remains yet very much land to be possessed. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "This is the land that still remains: all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites;</verse>
    <verse value="3"> from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even to the border of Ekron northward, which is counted as Canaanite; the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avvim,</verse>

    <verse value="5"> and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise, from Baal Gad under Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamath;</verse>
    <verse value="6"> all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim, even all the Sidonians; them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only allocate it to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh."</verse>
    <verse value="8"> With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them:</verse>
    <verse value="9"> from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon;</verse>

    <verse value="12"> all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (the same was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); for Moses attacked these, and drove them out.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Nevertheless the children of Israel didn't drive out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites: but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day.</verse>

    <verse value="22"> The children of Israel alse killed Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, with the sword, among the rest of their slain. |</verse>

    <verse value="26"> and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir;</verse>
    <verse value="27"> and in the valley, Beth Haram, Beth Nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, the Jordan's bank, to the uttermost part of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families, the cities and its villages. |</verse>
