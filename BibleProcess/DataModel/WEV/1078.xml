    <verse value="1">Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia, you do likewise.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> On the first day of the week, let each one of you save, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> When I arrive, I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> If it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with me.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> But I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> But with you it may be that I will stay, or even winter, that you may send me on my journey wherever I go.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> For I do not wish to see you now in passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost,</verse>
    <verse value="9"> for a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Therefore let no one despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brothers. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Now concerning Apollos, the brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers; and it was not at all his desire to come now; but he will come when he has an opportunity. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be courageous! Be strong!</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Let all that you do be done in love. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Now I beg you, brothers (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to serve the saints),</verse>
    <verse value="16"> that you also be in subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for that which was lacking on your part, they supplied.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge those who are like that. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> The assemblies of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, together with the assembly that is in their house.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> This greeting is by me, Paul, with my own hand.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> If any man doesn't love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed {Greek: anathema.}. Come, Lord! {Aramaic: Maranatha!}</verse>
    <verse value="23"> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen. |</verse>
