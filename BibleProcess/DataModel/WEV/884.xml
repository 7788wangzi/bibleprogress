    <verse value="1">Listen to this word which I take up for a lamentation over you, O house of Israel. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "The virgin of Israel has fallen; / She shall rise no more. | She is cast down on her land; / there is no one to raise her up." |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For thus says the Lord Yahweh: | "The city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left, / and that which went forth one hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel." |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> For thus says Yahweh to the house of Israel: | "Seek me, and you will live; |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> but don't seek Bethel, / nor enter into Gilgal, / and don't pass to Beersheba: | for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, / and Bethel shall come to nothing. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Seek Yahweh, and you will live; / lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, / and it devour, and there be no one to quench it in Bethel. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> You who turn justice to wormwood, / and cast down righteousness to the earth: |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> seek him who made the Pleiades and Orion, / and turns the shadow of death into the morning, / and makes the day dark with night; / who calls for the waters of the sea, / and pours them out on the surface of the earth, Yahweh is his name, |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> who brings sudden destruction on the strong, / so that destruction comes on the fortress. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> They hate him who reproves in the gate, / and they abhor him who speaks blamelessly. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Forasmuch therefore as you trample on the poor, / and take taxes from him of wheat: / You have built houses of cut stone, / but you will not dwell in them. | You have planted pleasant vineyards, / but you shall not drink their wine. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> For I know how many your offenses, / and how great are your sins-- / you who afflict the just, / who take a bribe, / and who turn aside the needy in the courts. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Therefore a prudent person keeps silent in such a time, / for it is an evil time. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Seek good, and not evil, / that you may live; / and so Yahweh, the God of Armies, will be with you, / as you say. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Hate evil, love good, / and establish justice in the courts. / It may be that Yahweh, the God of Armies, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph." |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Armies, the Lord: | "Wailing will be in all the broad ways; / and they will say in all the streets, 'Alas! Alas!' / and they will call the farmer to mourning, / and those who are skillful in lamentation to wailing. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> In all vineyards there will be wailing; / for I will pass through the midst of you," says Yahweh. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> "Woe to you who desire the day of Yahweh! / Why do you long for the day of Yahweh? | It is darkness, / and not light. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> As if a man fled from a lion, / and a bear met him; | Or he went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, / and a snake bit him. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Won't the day of Yahweh be darkness, and not light? / Even very dark, and no brightness in it? |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> I hate, I despise your feasts, / and I can't stand your solemn assemblies. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Yes, though you offer me your burnt offerings and meal offerings, / I will not accept them; / neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat animals. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Take away from me the noise of your songs! / I will not listen to the music of your harps. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> But let justice roll on like rivers, / and righteousness like a mighty stream. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> "Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, house of Israel?</verse>
    <verse value="26"> You also carried the tent of your king and the shrine of your images, the star of your god, which you made for yourselves.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus," says Yahweh, whose name is the God of Armies. |</verse>
