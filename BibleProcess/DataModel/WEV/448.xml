    <verse value="1">Then Job answered, |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "No doubt, but you are the people, / and wisdom shall die with you. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> But I have understanding as well as you; / I am not inferior to you. / Yes, who doesn't know such things as these? |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor, / I, who called on God, and he answered. / The just, the blameless man is a joke. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune. / It is ready for them whose foot slips. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> The tents of robbers prosper. / Those who provoke God are secure, / who carry their God in their hands. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> "But ask the animals, now, and they shall teach you; / the birds of the sky, and they shall tell you. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach you. / The fish of the sea shall declare to you. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Who doesn't know that in all these, / the hand of Yahweh has done this, |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> in whose hand is the life of every living thing, / and the breath of all mankind? |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Doesn't the ear try words, / even as the palate tastes its food? |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> With aged men is wisdom, / in length of days understanding. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> "With God is wisdom and might. / He has counsel and understanding. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Behold, he breaks down, and it can't be built again. / He imprisons a man, and there can be no release. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Behold, he withholds the waters, and they dry up. / Again, he sends them out, and they overturn the earth. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> With him is strength and wisdom. / The deceived and the deceiver are his. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> He leads counselors away stripped. / He makes judges fools. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> He loosens the bond of kings. / He binds their waist with a belt. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> He leads priests away stripped, / and overthrows the mighty. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> He removes the speech of those who are trusted, / and takes away the understanding of the elders. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> He pours contempt on princes, / and loosens the belt of the strong. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> He uncovers deep things out of darkness, / and brings out to light the shadow of death. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> He increases the nations, and he destroys them. / He enlarges the nations, and he leads them captive. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth, / and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> They grope in the dark without light. / He makes them stagger like a drunken man. |</verse>
