    <verse value="1">A Psalm by David. | Yahweh, I have called on you. / Come to me quickly! / Listen to my voice when I call to you. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Let my prayer be set before you like incense; / the lifting up of my hands like the evening sacrifice. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Set a watch, Yahweh, before my mouth. / Keep the door of my lips. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Don't incline my heart to any evil thing, / to practice deeds of wickedness with men who work iniquity. / Don't let me eat of their delicacies. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Let the righteous strike me, it is kindness; / let him reprove me, it is like oil on the head; / don't let my head refuse it; / Yet my prayer is always against evil deeds. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock. / They will hear my words, for they are well spoken. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> "As when one plows and breaks up the earth, / our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol {Sheol is the place of the dead.}." |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> For my eyes are on you, Yahweh, the Lord. / In you, I take refuge. / Don't leave my soul destitute. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, / from the traps of the workers of iniquity. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Let the wicked fall together into their own nets, / while I pass by. |</verse>
