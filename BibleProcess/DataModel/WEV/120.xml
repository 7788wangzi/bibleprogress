    <verse value="1">Now this is the history of the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that Yahweh spoke with Moses in Mount Sinai.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> These are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests who were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's office.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Nadab and Abihu died before Yahweh, when they offered strange fire before Yahweh, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children. Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest's office in the presence of Aaron their father. |</verse>

    <verse value="13"> for all the firstborn are mine. On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I made holy to me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and animal. They shall be mine. I am Yahweh." |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,</verse>
    <verse value="15"> "Count the children of Levi by their fathers' houses, by their families. You shall count every male from a month old and upward." |</verse>

    <verse value="40"> Yahweh said to Moses, "Number all the firstborn males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.</verse>
    <verse value="41"> You shall take the Levites for me (I am Yahweh) instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the livestock of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the livestock of the children of Israel." |</verse>

    <verse value="43"> All the firstborn males according to the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those who were numbered of them, were twenty-two thousand two hundred seventy-three. |</verse>
    <verse value="44"> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
    <verse value="45"> "Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites instead of their livestock; and the Levites shall be mine. I am Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse value="46"> For the redemption of the two hundred seventy-three of the firstborn of the children of Israel, who exceed the number of the Levites,</verse>
    <verse value="47"> you shall take five shekels apiece for each one; after the shekel of the sanctuary you shall take them (the shekel is twenty gerahs):</verse>
    <verse value="48"> and you shall give the money, with which their remainder is redeemed, to Aaron and to his sons." |</verse>
    <verse value="49"> Moses took the redemption money from those who exceeded the number of those who were redeemed by the Levites;</verse>
