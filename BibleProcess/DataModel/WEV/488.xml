    <verse value="1">Why do you stand far off, Yahweh? / Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble? |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the weak. / They are caught in the schemes that they devise. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For the wicked boasts of his heart's cravings. / He blesses the greedy, and condemns Yahweh. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> The wicked, in the pride of his face, / has no room in his thoughts for God. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> His ways are prosperous at all times. / He is haughty, and your laws are far from his sight. | As for all his adversaries, he sneers at them. /</verse>
    <verse value="6"> He says in his heart, "I shall not be shaken. / For generations I shall have no trouble." |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression. / Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> He lies in wait near the villages. / From ambushes, he murders the innocent. | His eyes are secretly set against the helpless. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> He lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush. / He lies in wait to catch the helpless. / He catches the helpless, when he draws him in his net. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> The helpless are crushed. / They collapse. / They fall under his strength. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> He says in his heart, "God has forgotten. / He hides his face. / He will never see it." |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Arise, Yahweh! / God, lift up your hand! / Don't forget the helpless. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Why does the wicked person condemn God, / and say in his heart, "God won't call me into account?" |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> But you do see trouble and grief. / You consider it to take it into your hand. / You help the victim and the fatherless. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Break the arm of the wicked. / As for the evil man, seek out his wickedness until you find none. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Yahweh is King forever and ever! / The nations will perish out of his land. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Yahweh, you have heard the desire of the humble. / You will prepare their heart. / You will cause your ear to hear, /</verse>
    <verse value="18"> to judge the fatherless and the oppressed, / that man who is of the earth may terrify no more. |</verse>
