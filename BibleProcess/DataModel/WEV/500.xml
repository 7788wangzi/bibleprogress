    <verse value="1">For the Chief Musician; set to "The Doe of the Morning." A Psalm by David. | My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? / Why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my groaning? |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> My God, I cry in the daytime, but you don't answer; / in the night season, and am not silent. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> But you are holy, / you who inhabit the praises of Israel. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Our fathers trusted in you. / They trusted, and you delivered them. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> They cried to you, and were delivered. / They trusted in you, and were not disappointed. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> But I am a worm, and no man; / a reproach of men, and despised by the people. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> All those who see me mock me. / They insult me with their lips. They shake their heads, saying, /</verse>
    <verse value="8"> "He trusts in Yahweh; / let him deliver him. / Let him rescue him, since he delights in him." |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> But you brought me out of the womb. / You made me trust at my mother's breasts. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> I was thrown on you from my mother's womb. / You are my God since my mother bore me. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Don't be far from me, for trouble is near. / For there is none to help. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Many bulls have surrounded me. / Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled me. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> They open their mouths wide against me, / lions tearing prey and roaring. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> I am poured out like water. / All my bones are out of joint. | My heart is like wax; / it is melted within me. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> My strength is dried up like a potsherd. / My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. | You have brought me into the dust of death. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> For dogs have surrounded me. / A company of evildoers have enclosed me. / They have pierced my hands and feet. {So Dead Sea Scrolls. Masoretic Text reads, "Like a lion, they pin my hands and feet."} |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> I can count all of my bones. | They look and stare at me. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> They divide my garments among them. / They cast lots for my clothing. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> But don't be far off, Yahweh. / You are my help: hurry to help me. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Deliver my soul from the sword, / my precious life from the power of the dog. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Save me from the lion's mouth! / Yes, from the horns of the wild oxen, you have answered me. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> I will declare your name to my brothers. / In the midst of the assembly, I will praise you. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> You who fear Yahweh, praise him! / All you descendants of Jacob, glorify him! / Stand in awe of him, all you descendants of Israel! |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, / Neither has he hidden his face from him; / but when he cried to him, he heard. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Of you comes my praise in the great assembly. / I will pay my vows before those who fear him. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> The humble shall eat and be satisfied. / They shall praise Yahweh who seek after him. / Let your hearts live forever. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to Yahweh. / All the relatives of the nations shall worship before you. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> For the kingdom is Yahweh's. / He is the ruler over the nations. |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> All the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship. / All those who go down to the dust shall bow before him, / even he who can't keep his soul alive. |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Posterity shall serve him. / Future generations shall be told about the Lord. |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> They shall come and shall declare his righteousness to a people that shall be born, / for he has done it. |</verse>
