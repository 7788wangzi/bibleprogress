    <verse value="1">Where do wars and fightings among you come from? Don't they come from your pleasures that war in your members?</verse>
    <verse value="2"> You lust, and don't have. You kill, covet, and can't obtain. You fight and make war. You don't have, because you don't ask.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> You ask, and don't receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it for your pleasures.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> You adulterers and adulteresses, don't you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, "The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously"?</verse>
    <verse value="6"> But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, "God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble." {Proverbs 3:34}</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Be subject therefore to God. But resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloom.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Don't speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge another? |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow let's go into this city, and spend a year there, trade, and make a profit."</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Whereas you don't know what your life will be like tomorrow. For what is your life? For you are a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> For you ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we will both live, and do this or that."</verse>
    <verse value="16"> But now you glory in your boasting. All such boasting is evil.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> To him therefore who knows to do good, and doesn't do it, to him it is sin. |</verse>
