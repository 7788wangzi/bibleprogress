    <verse value="1">"My spirit is consumed. / My days are extinct, / And the grave is ready for me. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Surely there are mockers with me. / My eye dwells on their provocation. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> "Now give a pledge, be collateral for me with yourself. / Who is there who will strike hands with me? |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> For you have hidden their heart from understanding, / Therefore you shall not exalt them. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> He who denounces his friends for a prey, / Even the eyes of his children shall fail. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> "But he has made me a byword of the people. / They spit in my face. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow. / All my members are as a shadow. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Upright men shall be astonished at this. / The innocent shall stir up himself against the godless. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Yet shall the righteous hold on his way. / He who has clean hands shall grow stronger and stronger. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> But as for you all, come on now again; / I shall not find a wise man among you. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> My days are past, my plans are broken off, / as are the thoughts of my heart. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> They change the night into day, / saying 'The light is near' in the presence of darkness. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> If I look for Sheol {Sheol is the place of the dead.} as my house, / if I have spread my couch in the darkness, |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> If I have said to corruption, 'You are my father;' / to the worm, 'My mother,' and 'my sister;' |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> where then is my hope? / as for my hope, who shall see it? |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Shall it go down with me to the gates of Sheol {Sheol is the place of the dead.}, / or descend together into the dust?" |</verse>
