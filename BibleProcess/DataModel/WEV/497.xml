    <verse value="1">For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David. | The heavens declare the glory of God. / The expanse shows his handiwork. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Day after day they pour forth speech, / and night after night they display knowledge. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> There is no speech nor language, / where their voice is not heard. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Their voice has gone out through all the earth, / their words to the end of the world. | In them he has set a tent for the sun, /</verse>
    <verse value="5"> which is as a bridegroom coming out of his room, / like a strong man rejoicing to run his course. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> His going forth is from the end of the heavens, / his circuit to its ends; / There is nothing hidden from its heat. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Yahweh's law is perfect, restoring the soul. / Yahweh's testimony is sure, making wise the simple. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Yahweh's precepts are right, rejoicing the heart. / Yahweh's commandment is pure, enlightening the eyes. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> The fear of Yahweh is clean, enduring forever. / Yahweh's ordinances are true, and righteous altogether. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> More to be desired are they than gold, yes, than much fine gold; / sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Moreover by them is your servant warned. / In keeping them there is great reward. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Who can discern his errors? / Forgive me from hidden errors. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins. / Let them not have dominion over me. | Then I will be upright. / I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart / be acceptable in your sight, / Yahweh, my rock, and my redeemer. |</verse>
