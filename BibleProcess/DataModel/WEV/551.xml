    <verse value="1">A Psalm by Asaph. | Surely God {The Hebrew word rendered "God" is "Elohim."} is good to Israel, / to those who are pure in heart. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> But as for me, my feet were almost gone. / My steps had nearly slipped. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For I was envious of the arrogant, / when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> For there are no struggles in their death, / but their strength is firm. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> They are free from burdens of men, / neither are they plagued like other men. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Therefore pride is like a chain around their neck. / Violence covers them like a garment. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Their eyes bulge with fat. / Their minds pass the limits of conceit. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> They scoff and speak with malice. / In arrogance, they threaten oppression. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> They have set their mouth in the heavens. / Their tongue walks through the earth. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Therefore their people return to them, / and they drink up waters of abundance. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> They say, "How does God know? / Is there knowledge in the Most High?" |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Behold, these are the wicked. / Being always at ease, they increase in riches. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Surely in vain I have cleansed my heart, / and washed my hands in innocence, |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> For all day long have I been plagued, / and punished every morning. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> If I had said, "I will speak thus"; / behold, I would have betrayed the generation of your children. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> When I tried to understand this, / it was too painful for me; |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Until I entered God's sanctuary, / and considered their latter end. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Surely you set them in slippery places. / You throw them down to destruction. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> How they are suddenly destroyed! / They are completely swept away with terrors. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> As a dream when one wakes up, / so, Lord, {The word translated "Lord" is "Adonai."} when you awake, you will despise their fantasies. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> For my soul was grieved. / I was embittered in my heart. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> I was so senseless and ignorant. / I was a brute beast before you. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Nevertheless, I am continually with you. / You have held my right hand. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> You will guide me with your counsel, / and afterward receive me to glory. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Whom do I have in heaven? / There is no one on earth whom I desire besides you. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> My flesh and my heart fails, / but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> For, behold, those who are far from you shall perish. / You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> But it is good for me to come close to God. / I have made the Lord Yahweh {"Yahweh" is God's proper Name, sometimes rendered "LORD" (all caps) in other translations.} my refuge, / that I may tell of all your works. |</verse>
