    <verse value="1">Therefore I urge you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Don't be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think reasonably, as God has apportioned to each person a measure of faith.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members don't have the same function,</verse>
    <verse value="5"> so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, if prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith;</verse>
    <verse value="7"> or service, let us give ourselves to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching;</verse>
    <verse value="8"> or he who exhorts, to his exhorting: he who gives, let him do it with liberality; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate one to another; in honor preferring one another;</verse>
    <verse value="11"> not lagging in diligence; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;</verse>
    <verse value="12"> rejoicing in hope; enduring in troubles; continuing steadfastly in prayer;</verse>
    <verse value="13"> contributing to the needs of the saints; given to hospitality.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Bless those who persecute you; bless, and don't curse.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those who weep.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Be of the same mind one toward another. Don't set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Don't be wise in your own conceits.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Repay no one evil for evil. Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> If it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Don't seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God's wrath. For it is written, "Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord." {Deuteronomy 32:35}</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Therefore | "If your enemy is hungry, feed him. / If he is thirsty, give him a drink; / for in doing so, you will heap coals of fire on his head." {Proverbs 25:21-22} |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Don't be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. |</verse>
