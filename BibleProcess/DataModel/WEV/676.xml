    <verse value="1">I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride. / I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; / I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; / I have drunk my wine with my milk. | Friends | Eat, friends! / Drink, yes, drink abundantly, beloved. | Beloved |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> I was asleep, but my heart was awake. / It is the voice of my beloved who knocks: / "Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; / for my head is filled with dew, / and my hair with the dampness of the night." |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> I have taken off my robe. Indeed, must I put it on? / I have washed my feet. Indeed, must I soil them? |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> My beloved thrust his hand in through the latch opening. / My heart pounded for him. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> I rose up to open for my beloved. / My hands dripped with myrrh, / my fingers with liquid myrrh, / on the handles of the lock. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> I opened to my beloved; / but my beloved left; and had gone away. | My heart went out when he spoke. / I looked for him, but I didn't find him. / I called him, but he didn't answer. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> The watchmen who go about the city found me. / They beat me. / They bruised me. / The keepers of the walls took my cloak away from me. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, / If you find my beloved, / that you tell him that I am faint with love. | Friends |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> How is your beloved better than another beloved, / you fairest among women? | How is your beloved better than another beloved, | that you do so adjure us? | Beloved |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> My beloved is white and ruddy. / The best among ten thousand. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> His head is like the purest gold. / His hair is bushy, black as a raven. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks, / washed with milk, mounted like jewels. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> His cheeks are like a bed of spices with towers of perfumes. / His lips are like lilies, dropping liquid myrrh. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> His hands are like rings of gold set with beryl. / His body is like ivory work overlaid with sapphires. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> His legs are like pillars of marble set on sockets of fine gold. / His appearance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> His mouth is sweetness; / yes, he is altogether lovely. | This is my beloved, and this is my friend, / daughters of Jerusalem. | Friends |</verse>
