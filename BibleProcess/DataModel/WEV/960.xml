    <verse value="1">He entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had his hand withered.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> They watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> He said to the man who had his hand withered, "Stand up."</verse>
    <verse value="4"> He said to them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?" But they were silent.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> When he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> The Pharisees went out, and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea,</verse>
    <verse value="8"> from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> He spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they wouldn't press on him.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, "You are the Son of God!"</verse>
    <verse value="12"> He sternly warned them that they should not make him known. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> He went up into the mountain, and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> He appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach,</verse>
    <verse value="15"> and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter;</verse>
    <verse value="17"> James the son of Zebedee; John, the brother of James, and he surnamed them Boanerges, which means, Sons of Thunder;</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot;</verse>
    <verse value="19"> and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. | He came into a house.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> The multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> When his friends heard it, they went out to seize him: for they said, "He is insane."</verse>
    <verse value="22"> The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, "He has Beelzebul," and, "By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons." |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> He summoned them, and said to them in parables, "How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
    <verse value="24"> If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> If Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he can't stand, but has an end.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man; and then he will plunder his house.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Most certainly I tell you, all sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme;</verse>
    <verse value="29"> but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin"</verse>
    <verse value="30"> --because they said, "He has an unclean spirit." |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> His mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> A multitude was sitting around him, and they told him, "Behold, your mother, your brothers, and your sisters {TR omits "your sisters"} are outside looking for you." |</verse>
    <verse value="33"> He answered them, "Who are my mother and my brothers?"</verse>
    <verse value="34"> Looking around at those who sat around him, he said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!</verse>
    <verse value="35"> For whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother." |</verse>
