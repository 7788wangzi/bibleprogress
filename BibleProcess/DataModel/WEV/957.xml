    <verse value="1">Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> The angel answered the women, "Don't be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.' Behold, I have told you." |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!" | They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Then Jesus said to them, "Don't be afraid. Go tell my brothers {The word for "brothers" here may be also correctly translated "brothers and sisters" or "siblings."} that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me." |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had happened.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> When they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,</verse>
    <verse value="13"> saying, "Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> If this comes to the governor's ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry."</verse>
    <verse value="15"> So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until this day. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Go, {TR and NU add "therefore"} and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
    <verse value="20"> teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age." Amen. |</verse>
