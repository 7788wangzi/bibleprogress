    <verse value="1">"I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Every branch in me that doesn't bear fruit, he takes away. Every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch can't bear fruit by itself, unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> I am the vine. You are the branches. He who remains in me, and I in him, the same bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> If a man doesn't remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> "In this is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; and so you will be my disciples.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Even as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you. Remain in my love.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and remain in his love.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> I have spoken these things to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be made full. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> "This is my commandment, that you love one another, even as I have loved you.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> No longer do I call you servants, for the servant doesn't know what his lord does. But I have called you friends, for everything that I heard from my Father, I have made known to you.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> You didn't choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> "I command these things to you, that you may love one another.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, since I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Remember the word that I said to you: 'A servant is not greater than his lord.' {John 13:16} If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will keep yours also.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> But all these things will they do to you for my name's sake, because they don't know him who sent me.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> He who hates me, hates my Father also.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> If I hadn't done among them the works which no one else did, they wouldn't have had sin. But now have they seen and also hated both me and my Father.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> But this happened so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law, 'They hated me without a cause.' {Psalms 35:19; 69:4} |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> "When the Counselor {Greek Parakletos: Counselor, Helper, Advocate, Intercessor, and Comforter.} has come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will testify about me.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> You will also testify, because you have been with me from the beginning. |</verse>
