    <verse value="1">For the Chief Musician. To Jeduthun. A Psalm by Asaph. | My cry goes to God! / Indeed, I cry to God for help, / and for him to listen to me. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord. / My hand was stretched out in the night, and didn't get tired. / My soul refused to be comforted. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> I remember God, and I groan. / I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. | Selah. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> You hold my eyelids open. / I am so troubled that I can't speak. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> I have considered the days of old, / the years of ancient times. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> I remember my song in the night. / I consider in my own heart; / my spirit diligently inquires: |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> "Will the Lord reject us forever? / Will he be favorable no more? |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Has his loving kindness vanished forever? / Does his promise fail for generations? |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Has God forgotten to be gracious? / Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?" | Selah. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Then I thought, "I will appeal to this: / the years of the right hand of the Most High." |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> I will remember Yah's deeds; / for I will remember your wonders of old. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> I will also meditate on all your work, / and consider your doings. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Your way, God, is in the sanctuary. / What god is great like God? |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> You are the God who does wonders. / You have made your strength known among the peoples. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> You have redeemed your people with your arm, / the sons of Jacob and Joseph. | Selah. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> The waters saw you, God. / The waters saw you, and they writhed. / The depths also convulsed. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> The clouds poured out water. / The skies resounded with thunder. / Your arrows also flashed around. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind. / The lightnings lit up the world. / The earth trembled and shook. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Your way was through the sea; / your paths through the great waters. / Your footsteps were not known. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> You led your people like a flock, / by the hand of Moses and Aaron. |</verse>
