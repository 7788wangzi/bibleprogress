    <verse value="1">"I made a covenant with my eyes, / how then should I look lustfully at a young woman? |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> For what is the portion from God above, / and the heritage from the Almighty on high? |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, / and disaster to the workers of iniquity? |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Doesn't he see my ways, / and number all my steps? |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> "If I have walked with falsehood, / and my foot has hurried to deceit |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> (let me be weighed in an even balance, / that God may know my integrity); |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> if my step has turned out of the way, / if my heart walked after my eyes, / if any defilement has stuck to my hands, |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> then let me sow, and let another eat. / Yes, let the produce of my field be rooted out. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> "If my heart has been enticed to a woman, / and I have laid wait at my neighbor's door, |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> then let my wife grind for another, / and let others sleep with her. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> For that would be a heinous crime. / Yes, it would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges: |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> For it is a fire that consumes to destruction, / and would root out all my increase. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> "If I have despised the cause of my male servant / or of my female servant, / when they contended with me; |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> What then shall I do when God rises up? / When he visits, what shall I answer him? |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Didn't he who made me in the womb make him? / Didn't one fashion us in the womb? |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> "If I have withheld the poor from their desire, / or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail, |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> or have eaten my morsel alone, / and the fatherless has not eaten of it |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> (no, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, / her have I guided from my mother's womb); |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> if I have seen any perish for want of clothing, / or that the needy had no covering; |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> if his heart hasn't blessed me, / if he hasn't been warmed with my sheep's fleece; |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, / because I saw my help in the gate, |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade, / and my arm be broken from the bone. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> For calamity from God is a terror to me. / Because his majesty, I can do nothing. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> "If I have made gold my hope, / and have said to the fine gold, 'You are my confidence;' |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, / and because my hand had gotten much; |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> if I have seen the sun when it shined, / or the moon moving in splendor, |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> and my heart has been secretly enticed, / and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth, |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges; / for I should have denied the God who is above. |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> "If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me, / or lifted up myself when evil found him; |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> (yes, I have not allowed my mouth to sin / by asking his life with a curse); |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> if the men of my tent have not said, / 'Who can find one who has not been filled with his meat?' |</verse>
    <verse value="32"> (the foreigner has not lodged in the street, / but I have opened my doors to the traveler); |</verse>
    <verse value="33"> if like Adam I have covered my transgressions, / by hiding my iniquity in my heart, |</verse>
    <verse value="34"> because I feared the great multitude, / and the contempt of families terrified me, / so that I kept silence, and didn't go out of the door-- |</verse>
    <verse value="35"> oh that I had one to hear me! / (behold, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me); / let the accuser write my indictment! |</verse>
    <verse value="36"> Surely I would carry it on my shoulder; / and I would bind it to me as a crown. |</verse>
    <verse value="37"> I would declare to him the number of my steps. / as a prince would I go near to him. |</verse>
    <verse value="38"> If my land cries out against me, / and its furrows weep together; |</verse>
    <verse value="39"> if I have eaten its fruits without money, / or have caused its owners to lose their life, |</verse>
    <verse value="40"> let briars grow instead of wheat, / and stinkweed instead of barley." | The words of Job are ended. |</verse>
