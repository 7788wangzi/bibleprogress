    <verse value="1">For this cause I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles,</verse>
    <verse value="2"> if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you;</verse>
    <verse value="3"> how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I wrote before in few words,</verse>
    <verse value="4"> by which, when you read, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;</verse>
    <verse value="5"> which in other generations was not made known to the children of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;</verse>
    <verse value="6"> that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus through the Good News,</verse>
    <verse value="7"> of which I was made a servant, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> To me, the very least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,</verse>
    <verse value="9"> and to make all men see what is the administration {TR reads "fellowship" instead of "administration"} of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ;</verse>
    <verse value="10"> to the intent that now through the assembly the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places,</verse>
    <verse value="11"> according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord;</verse>
    <verse value="12"> in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Therefore I ask that you may not lose heart at my troubles for you, which are your glory. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> For this cause, I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
    <verse value="15"> from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,</verse>
    <verse value="16"> that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that you may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man;</verse>
    <verse value="17"> that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that you, being rooted and grounded in love,</verse>
    <verse value="18"> may be strengthened to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,</verse>
    <verse value="19"> and to know Christ's love which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,</verse>
    <verse value="21"> to him be the glory in the assembly and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen. |</verse>
