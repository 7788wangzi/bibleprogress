    <verse value="1">On that day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the seaside.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Great multitudes gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat, and sat, and all the multitude stood on the beach.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> He spoke to them many things in parables, saying, "Behold, a farmer went out to sow.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> As he sowed, some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds came and devoured them.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Others fell on rocky ground, where they didn't have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, because they had no depth of earth.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> When the sun had risen, they were scorched. Because they had no root, they withered away.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Others fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked them.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Others fell on good soil, and yielded fruit: some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> He who has ears to hear, let him hear." |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> The disciples came, and said to him, "Why do you speak to them in parables?" |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> He answered them, "To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but it is not given to them.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> For whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have abundance, but whoever doesn't have, from him will be taken away even that which he has.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they don't see, and hearing, they don't hear, neither do they understand.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says,  | 'By hearing you will hear, / and will in no way understand; | Seeing you will see, / and will in no way perceive: |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> for this people's heart has grown callous, / their ears are dull of hearing, / they have closed their eyes; | or else perhaps they might perceive with their eyes, / hear with their ears, / understand with their heart, | and should turn again; / and I would heal them.' {Isaiah 6:9-10} |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> "But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> For most certainly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see, and didn't see them; and to hear the things which you hear, and didn't hear them. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> "Hear, then, the parable of the farmer.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> When anyone hears the word of the Kingdom, and doesn't understand it, the evil one comes, and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown by the roadside.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> What was sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word, and immediately with joy receives it;</verse>
    <verse value="21"> yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> What was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> What was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it, who most certainly bears fruit, and brings forth, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty." |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> He set another parable before them, saying, "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field,</verse>
    <verse value="25"> but while people slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel weeds {darnel is a weed grass (probably bearded darnel or lolium temulentum) that looks very much like wheat until it is mature, when the difference becomes very apparent.} also among the wheat, and went away.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then the darnel weeds appeared also.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> The servants of the householder came and said to him, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where did this darnel come from?' |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> "He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.' | "The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and gather them up?' |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> "But he said, 'No, lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds, you root up the wheat with them.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest time I will tell the reapers, "First, gather up the darnel weeds, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn."'" |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> He set another parable before them, saying, "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field;</verse>
    <verse value="32"> which indeed is smaller than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches." |</verse>
    <verse value="33"> He spoke another parable to them. "The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast, which a woman took, and hid in three measures {literally, three sata. 3 sata is about 39 litres or a bit more than a bushel} of meal, until it was all leavened." |</verse>
    <verse value="34"> Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable, he didn't speak to them,</verse>
    <verse value="35"> that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,  | "I will open my mouth in parables; / I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world." {Psalm 78:2} |</verse>
    <verse value="36"> Then Jesus sent the multitudes away, and went into the house. His disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the field." |</verse>
    <verse value="37"> He answered them, "He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,</verse>
    <verse value="38"> the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the children of the Kingdom; and the darnel weeds are the children of the evil one.</verse>
    <verse value="39"> The enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.</verse>
    <verse value="40"> As therefore the darnel weeds are gathered up and burned with fire; so will it be at the end of this age.</verse>
    <verse value="41"> The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his Kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and those who do iniquity,</verse>
    <verse value="42"> and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</verse>
    <verse value="43"> Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear. |</verse>
    <verse value="44"> "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found, and hid. In his joy, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field. |</verse>
    <verse value="45"> "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls,</verse>
    <verse value="46"> who having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it. |</verse>
    <verse value="47"> "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet, that was cast into the sea, and gathered some fish of every kind,</verse>
    <verse value="48"> which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach. They sat down, and gathered the good into containers, but the bad they threw away.</verse>
    <verse value="49"> So will it be in the end of the world. The angels will come forth, and separate the wicked from among the righteous,</verse>
    <verse value="50"> and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth."</verse>
    <verse value="51"> Jesus said to them, "Have you understood all these things?" | They answered him, "Yes, Lord." |</verse>
    <verse value="52"> He said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings out of his treasure new and old things." |</verse>
    <verse value="53"> It happened that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there.</verse>
    <verse value="54"> Coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom, and these mighty works?</verse>
    <verse value="55"> Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James, Joses, Simon, and Judas {or, Judah}?</verse>
    <verse value="56"> Aren't all of his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all of these things?"</verse>
    <verse value="57"> They were offended by him. | But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house."</verse>
    <verse value="58"> He didn't do many mighty works there because of their unbelief. |</verse>
