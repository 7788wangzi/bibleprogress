    <verse value="4"> If they blow just one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves to you.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> When you blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall go forward.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> When you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall go forward. They shall blow an alarm for their journeys.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> "The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets. This shall be to you for a statute forever throughout your generations.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> When you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets. Then you will be remembered before Yahweh your God, and you will be saved from your enemies. |</verse>
