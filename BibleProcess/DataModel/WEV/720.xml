    <verse value="1">"Keep silent before me, islands, / and let the peoples renew their strength. | Let them come near, / then let them speak. / Let's meet together for judgment. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Who has raised up one from the east? / Who called him to his foot in righteousness? / He hands over nations to him, / and makes him rule over kings. / He gives them like the dust to his sword, / like the driven stubble to his bow. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> He pursues them, / and passes by safely, / Even by a way that he had not gone with his feet. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Who has worked and done it, / calling the generations from the beginning? / I, Yahweh, the first, and with the last, I am he." |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> The islands have seen, and fear. / The ends of the earth tremble. / They approach, and come. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Everyone helps his neighbor. / They say to their brothers, "Be strong!" |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> So the carpenter encourages the goldsmith. / He who smoothes with the hammer encourages him who strikes the anvil, / saying of the soldering, "It is good"; / and he fastens it with nails, that it might not totter. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> "But you, Israel, my servant, / Jacob whom I have chosen, / the seed of Abraham my friend, /</verse>
    <verse value="9"> You whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth, / and called from its corners, / and said to you, 'You are my servant, I have chosen you and not cast you away;' |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Don't you be afraid, for I am with you. / Don't be dismayed, for I am your God. / I will strengthen you. / Yes, I will help you. / Yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Behold, all those who are incensed against you will be disappointed and confounded. / Those who strive with you will be like nothing, and shall perish. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> You will seek them, and won't find them, / even those who contend with you. / Those who war against you will be as nothing, / as a non-existent thing. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> For I, Yahweh your God, will hold your right hand, / saying to you, 'Don't be afraid. / I will help you.' |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Don't be afraid, you worm Jacob, / and you men of Israel. / I will help you," says Yahweh, / "and your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Behold, I have made you into a new sharp threshing instrument with teeth. / You will thresh the mountains, / and beat them small, / and will make the hills like chaff. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> You will winnow them, / and the wind will carry them away, / and the whirlwind will scatter them. | You will rejoice in Yahweh. / You will glory in the Holy One of Israel. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> The poor and needy seek water, and there is none. / Their tongue fails for thirst. | I, Yahweh, will answer them. / I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> I will open rivers on the bare heights, / and springs in the midst of the valleys. / I will make the wilderness a pool of water, / and the dry land springs of water. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> I will put cedar, acacia, myrtle, and oil trees in the wilderness. / I will set fir trees, pine, and box trees together in the desert; /</verse>
    <verse value="20"> that they may see, know, consider, and understand together, / that the hand of Yahweh has done this, / and the Holy One of Israel has created it. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Produce your cause," says Yahweh. / "Bring forth your strong reasons," says the King of Jacob. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> "Let them announce, and declare to us what shall happen. / Declare the former things, what they are, / that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; / or show us things to come. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Declare the things that are to come hereafter, / that we may know that you are gods. | Yes, do good, or do evil, / that we may be dismayed, / and see it together. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Behold, you are of nothing, / and your work is of nothing. / He who chooses you is an abomination. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> "I have raised up one from the north, and he has come; / from the rising of the sun, one who calls on my name; / and he shall come on rulers as on mortar, / and as the potter treads clay. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Who has declared it from the beginning, that we may know? / And before, that we may say, 'He is right?' | Surely, there is no one who declares. / Surely, there is no one who shows. / Surely, there is no one who hears your words. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> I am the first to say to Zion, 'Behold, look at them;' / and I will give one who brings good news to Jerusalem. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> When I look, there is no man; / even among them there is no counselor who, when I ask of them, can answer a word. |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Behold, all of them, their works are vanity and nothing. / Their molten images are wind and confusion. |</verse>
