    <verse value="1">But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</verse>
    <verse value="3"> without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,</verse>
    <verse value="4"> traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;</verse>
    <verse value="5"> holding a form of godliness, but having denied its power. Turn away from these, also.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> For some of these are people who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,</verse>
    <verse value="7"> always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith, are rejected.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,</verse>
    <verse value="11"> persecutions, and sufferings: those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. Out of them all the Lord delivered me.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Every Scripture is God-breathed and {or, Every writing inspired by God is} profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness,</verse>
    <verse value="17"> that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. |</verse>
