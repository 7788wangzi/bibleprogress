    <verse value="1">Since many have undertaken to set in order a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,</verse>
    <verse value="2"> even as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word delivered them to us,</verse>
    <verse value="3"> it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus;</verse>
    <verse value="4"> that you might know the certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> They were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Now it happened, while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his division,</verse>
    <verse value="9"> according to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> But the angel said to him, "Don't be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard, and your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> You will have joy and gladness; and many will rejoice at his birth.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord, their God.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, 'to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,' and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to prepare a people prepared for the Lord." |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Zacharias said to the angel, "How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years." |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> The angel answered him, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Behold, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things will happen, because you didn't believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time." |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> The people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled that he delayed in the temple.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> When he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> It happened, when the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> After these days Elizabeth, his wife, conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying,</verse>
    <verse value="25"> "Thus has the Lord done to me in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach among men." |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</verse>
    <verse value="27"> to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin's name was Mary.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Having come in, the angel said to her, "Rejoice, you highly favored one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women!" |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> The angel said to her, "Don't be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> Behold, you will conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son, and will call his name 'Jesus.'</verse>
    <verse value="32"> He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David,</verse>
    <verse value="33"> and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his Kingdom." |</verse>
    <verse value="34"> Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, seeing I am a virgin?" |</verse>
    <verse value="35"> The angel answered her, "The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one who is born from you will be called the Son of God.</verse>
    <verse value="36"> Behold, Elizabeth, your relative, also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.</verse>
    <verse value="37"> For everything spoken by God is possible." |</verse>
    <verse value="38"> Mary said, "Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it to me according to your word." | The angel departed from her.</verse>
    <verse value="39"> Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah,</verse>
    <verse value="40"> and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
    <verse value="41"> It happened, when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, that the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
    <verse value="42"> She called out with a loud voice, and said, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!</verse>
    <verse value="43"> Why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
    <verse value="44"> For behold, when the voice of your greeting came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy!</verse>
    <verse value="45"> Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord!" |</verse>
    <verse value="46"> Mary said, | "My soul magnifies the Lord. /</verse>
    <verse value="47"> My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior, /</verse>
    <verse value="48"> for he has looked at the humble state of his handmaid. | For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed. /</verse>
    <verse value="49"> For he who is mighty has done great things for me. / Holy is his name. /</verse>
    <verse value="50"> His mercy is for generations of generations on those who fear him. |</verse>
    <verse value="51"> He has shown strength with his arm. / He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. |</verse>
    <verse value="52"> He has put down princes from their thrones. / And has exalted the lowly. |</verse>
    <verse value="53"> He has filled the hungry with good things. / He has sent the rich away empty. |</verse>
    <verse value="54"> He has given help to Israel, his servant, that he might remember mercy, /</verse>
    <verse value="55"> As he spoke to our fathers, / to Abraham and his seed forever." |</verse>
    <verse value="56"> Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned to her house.</verse>
    <verse value="57"> Now the time that Elizabeth should give birth was fulfilled, and she brought forth a son.</verse>
    <verse value="58"> Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her, and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
    <verse value="59"> It happened on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of the father.</verse>
    <verse value="60"> His mother answered, "Not so; but he will be called John." |</verse>
    <verse value="61"> They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name."</verse>
    <verse value="62"> They made signs to his father, what he would have him called. |</verse>
    <verse value="63"> He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, "His name is John." | They all marveled.</verse>
    <verse value="64"> His mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing God.</verse>
    <verse value="65"> Fear came on all who lived around them, and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.</verse>
    <verse value="66"> All who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, "What then will this child be?" The hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
    <verse value="67"> His father, Zacharias, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying, |</verse>
    <verse value="68"> "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, / for he has visited and worked redemption for his people; |</verse>
    <verse value="69"> and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David /</verse>
    <verse value="70"> (as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been from of old), /</verse>
    <verse value="71"> salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us; |</verse>
    <verse value="72"> to show mercy towards our fathers, / to remember his holy covenant, |</verse>
    <verse value="73"> the oath which he spoke to Abraham, our father, /</verse>
    <verse value="74"> to grant to us that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, / should serve him without fear, /</verse>
    <verse value="75"> In holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life. |</verse>
    <verse value="76"> And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High, / for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways, /</verse>
    <verse value="77"> to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins, |</verse>
    <verse value="78"> because of the tender mercy of our God, / whereby the dawn from on high will visit us, /</verse>
    <verse value="79"> to shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death; / to guide our feet into the way of peace." |</verse>
    <verse value="80"> The child was growing, and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the desert until the day of his public appearance to Israel. |</verse>
