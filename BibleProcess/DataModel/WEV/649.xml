    <verse value="1">The king's heart is in Yahweh's hand like the watercourses. / He turns it wherever he desires. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, / but Yahweh weighs the hearts. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> To do righteousness and justice / is more acceptable to Yahweh than sacrifice. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> A high look, and a proud heart, / the lamp of the wicked, is sin. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> The plans of the diligent surely lead to profit; / and everyone who is hasty surely rushes to poverty. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Getting treasures by a lying tongue / is a fleeting vapor for those who seek death. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> The violence of the wicked will drive them away, / because they refuse to do what is right. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> The way of the guilty is devious, / but the conduct of the innocent is upright. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, / than to share a house with a contentious woman. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> The soul of the wicked desires evil; / his neighbor finds no mercy in his eyes. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> When the mocker is punished, the simple gains wisdom. / When the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked, / and brings the wicked to ruin. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor, / he will also cry out, but shall not be heard. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> A gift in secret pacifies anger; / and a bribe in the cloak, strong wrath. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> It is joy to the righteous to do justice; / but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> The man who wanders out of the way of understanding / shall rest in the assembly of the dead. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> He who loves pleasure shall be a poor man. / He who loves wine and oil shall not be rich. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> The wicked is a ransom for the righteous; / the treacherous for the upright. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> It is better to dwell in a desert land, / than with a contentious and fretful woman. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise; / but a foolish man swallows it up. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> He who follows after righteousness and kindness / finds life, righteousness, and honor. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> A wise man scales the city of the mighty, / and brings down the strength of its confidence. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue / keeps his soul from troubles. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> The proud and haughty man, "scoffer" is his name; / he works in the arrogance of pride. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> The desire of the sluggard kills him, / for his hands refuse to labor. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> There are those who covet greedily all day long; / but the righteous give and don't withhold. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination: / how much more, when he brings it with a wicked mind! |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> A false witness will perish, / and a man who listens speaks to eternity. |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> A wicked man hardens his face; / but as for the upright, he establishes his ways. |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> There is no wisdom nor understanding / nor counsel against Yahweh. |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> The horse is prepared for the day of battle; / but victory is with Yahweh. |</verse>
