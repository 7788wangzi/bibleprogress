    <verse value="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,  |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved? / But who can withhold himself from speaking? |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Behold, you have instructed many, / you have strengthened the weak hands. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Your words have supported him who was falling, / You have made firm the feeble knees. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> But now it has come to you, and you faint. / It touches you, and you are troubled. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Isn't your piety your confidence? / Isn't the integrity of your ways your hope? |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> "Remember, now, whoever perished, being innocent? / Or where were the upright cut off? |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity, / and sow trouble, / reap the same. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> By the breath of God they perish. / By the blast of his anger are they consumed. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> The roaring of the lion, / and the voice of the fierce lion, / the teeth of the young lions, are broken. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> The old lion perishes for lack of prey. / The cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> "Now a thing was secretly brought to me. / My ear received a whisper of it. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> In thoughts from the visions of the night, / when deep sleep falls on men, |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> fear came on me, and trembling, / which made all my bones shake. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Then a spirit passed before my face. / The hair of my flesh stood up. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> It stood still, but I couldn't discern its appearance. / A form was before my eyes. / Silence, then I heard a voice, saying, |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> 'Shall mortal man be more just than God? / Shall a man be more pure than his Maker? |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Behold, he puts no trust in his servants. / He charges his angels with error. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> How much more, those who dwell in houses of clay, / whose foundation is in the dust, / who are crushed before the moth! |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Between morning and evening they are destroyed. / They perish forever without any regarding it. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Isn't their tent cord plucked up within them? / They die, and that without wisdom.' |</verse>
