    <verse value="1">For the Chief Musician. By the sons of Korah. A contemplative psalm. | We have heard with our ears, God; / our fathers have told us, / what work you did in their days, / in the days of old. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> You drove out the nations with your hand, / but you planted them. | You afflicted the peoples, / but you spread them abroad. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For they didn't get the land in possession by their own sword, / neither did their own arm save them; | but your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your face, / because you were favorable to them. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> You are my King, God. / Command victories for Jacob! |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Through you, will we push down our adversaries. / Through your name, will we tread them under who rise up against us. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> For I will not trust in my bow, / neither shall my sword save me. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> But you have saved us from our adversaries, / and have shamed those who hate us. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> In God we have made our boast all day long, / we will give thanks to your name forever. | Selah. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> But now you rejected us, and brought us to dishonor, / and don't go out with our armies. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> You make us turn back from the adversary. / Those who hate us take spoil for themselves. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> You have made us like sheep for food, / and have scattered us among the nations. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> You sell your people for nothing, / and have gained nothing from their sale. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> You make us a reproach to our neighbors, / a scoffing and a derision to those who are around us. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> You make us a byword among the nations, / a shaking of the head among the peoples. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> All day long my dishonor is before me, / and shame covers my face, /</verse>
    <verse value="16"> At the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses, / because of the enemy and the avenger. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> All this has come on us, / yet have we not forgotten you, / Neither have we been false to your covenant. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Our heart has not turned back, / neither have our steps strayed from your path, /</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals, / and covered us with the shadow of death. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> If we have forgotten the name of our God, / or spread forth our hands to a strange god; /</verse>
    <verse value="21"> won't God search this out? / For he knows the secrets of the heart. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Yes, for your sake we are killed all day long. / We are regarded as sheep for the slaughter. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Wake up! / Why do you sleep, Lord? {The word translated "Lord" is "Adonai."} | Arise! / Don't reject us forever. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Why do you hide your face, / and forget our affliction and our oppression? |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> For our soul is bowed down to the dust. / Our body clings to the earth. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Rise up to help us. / Redeem us for your loving kindness' sake. |</verse>
