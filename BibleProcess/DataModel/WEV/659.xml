    <verse value="1">The words of king Lemuel; the oracle which his mother taught him. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Oh, my son! / Oh, son of my womb! / Oh, son of my vows! |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Don't give your strength to women, / nor your ways to that which destroys kings. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> It is not for kings, Lemuel; / it is not for kings to drink wine; / nor for princes to say, 'Where is strong drink?' |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> lest they drink, and forget the law, / and pervert the justice due to anyone who is afflicted. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish; / and wine to the bitter in soul: |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Let him drink, and forget his poverty, / and remember his misery no more. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Open your mouth for the mute, / in the cause of all who are left desolate. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Open your mouth, judge righteously, / and serve justice to the poor and needy." |</verse>
    <verse value="10">  {Proverbs 31:10-31 form an acrostic, with each verse starting with each letter of the Hebrew alphabet, in order.}Who can find a worthy woman? / For her price is far above rubies. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> The heart of her husband trusts in her. / He shall have no lack of gain. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> She does him good, and not harm, / all the days of her life. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> She seeks wool and flax, / and works eagerly with her hands. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> She is like the merchant ships. / She brings her bread from afar. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> She rises also while it is yet night, / gives food to her household, / and portions for her servant girls. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> She considers a field, and buys it. / With the fruit of her hands, she plants a vineyard. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> She arms her waist with strength, / and makes her arms strong. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. / Her lamp doesn't go out by night. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> She lays her hands to the distaff, / and her hands hold the spindle. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> She opens her arms to the poor; / yes, she extends her hands to the needy. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> She is not afraid of the snow for her household; / for all her household are clothed with scarlet. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> She makes for herself carpets of tapestry. / Her clothing is fine linen and purple. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Her husband is respected in the gates, / when he sits among the elders of the land. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> She makes linen garments and sells them, / and delivers sashes to the merchant. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Strength and dignity are her clothing. / She laughs at the time to come. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> She opens her mouth with wisdom. / Faithful instruction is on her tongue. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> She looks well to the ways of her household, / and doesn't eat the bread of idleness. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Her children rise up and call her blessed. / Her husband also praises her: |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> "Many women do noble things, / but you excel them all." |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain; / but a woman who fears Yahweh, she shall be praised. |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> Give her of the fruit of her hands! / Let her works praise her in the gates! |</verse>
