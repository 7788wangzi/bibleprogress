    <verse value="1">Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ; | To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers {or, superintendents, or bishops} and servants {Or, deacons}:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Grace to you, and peace from God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> I thank my God whenever I remember you,</verse>
    <verse value="4"> always in every request of mine on behalf of you all making my requests with joy,</verse>
    <verse value="5"> for your partnership {The word translated "partnership" (koinonia) also means "fellowship" and "sharing."} in furtherance of the Good News from the first day until now;</verse>
    <verse value="6"> being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> It is even right for me to think this way on behalf of all of you, because I have you in my heart, because, both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News, you all are partakers with me of grace.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> For God is my witness, how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> This I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment;</verse>
    <verse value="10"> so that you may approve the things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense to the day of Christ;</verse>
    <verse value="11"> being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Now I desire to have you know, brothers, {The word for "brothers" here and where context allows may also be correctly translated "brothers and sisters" or "siblings."} that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the Good News;</verse>
    <verse value="13"> so that it became evident to the whole palace {or, praetorian} guard, and to all the rest, that my bonds are in Christ;</verse>
    <verse value="14"> and that most of the brothers in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Some indeed preach Christ even out of envy and strife, and some also out of good will.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> The former insincerely preach Christ from selfish ambition, thinking that they add affliction to my chains;</verse>
    <verse value="17"> but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Good News. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> What does it matter? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed. I rejoice in this, yes, and will rejoice.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> For I know that this will turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</verse>
    <verse value="20"> according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will in no way be disappointed, but with all boldness, as always, now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> But if I live on in the flesh, this will bring fruit from my work; yet I don't know what I will choose.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> But I am in a dilemma between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Yet, to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Having this confidence, I know that I will remain, yes, and remain with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,</verse>
    <verse value="26"> that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Only let your way of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ, that, whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your state, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the Good News;</verse>
    <verse value="28"> and in nothing frightened by the adversaries, which is for them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that from God.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Because it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on his behalf,</verse>
    <verse value="30"> having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear is in me. |</verse>
