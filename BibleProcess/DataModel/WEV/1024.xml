    <verse value="1">Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, a complaint arose from the Hellenists {The Hellenists used Greek language and culture, even though they were also of Hebrew descent.} against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily service.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> The twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, "It is not appropriate for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Therefore select from among you, brothers, seven men of good report, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word." |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> These words pleased the whole multitude. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch;</verse>
    <verse value="6"> whom they set before the apostles. When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> The word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly. A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Stephen, full of faith and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> But some of those who were of the synagogue called "The Libertines," and of the Cyrenians, of the Alexandrians, and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose, disputing with Stephen.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> They weren't able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Then they secretly induced men to say, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God."</verse>
    <verse value="12"> They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and came against him and seized him, and brought him in to the council,</verse>
    <verse value="13"> and set up false witnesses who said, "This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us."</verse>
    <verse value="15"> All who sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face like it was the face of an angel. |</verse>
