    <verse value="1">"But now those who are younger than I have me in derision, / whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Of what use is the strength of their hands to me, / men in whom ripe age has perished? |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> They are gaunt from lack and famine. / They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of waste and desolation. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> They pluck salt herbs by the bushes. / The roots of the broom are their food. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> They are driven out from the midst of men. / They cry after them as after a thief; |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> So that they dwell in frightful valleys, / and in holes of the earth and of the rocks. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Among the bushes they bray; / and under the nettles they are gathered together. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> They are children of fools, yes, children of base men. / They were flogged out of the land. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> "Now I have become their song. / Yes, I am a byword to them. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, / and don't hesitate to spit in my face. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> For he has untied his cord, and afflicted me; / and they have thrown off restraint before me. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> On my right hand rise the rabble. / They thrust aside my feet, / They cast up against me their ways of destruction. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> They mar my path, / They set forward my calamity, / without anyone's help. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> As through a wide breach they come, / in the midst of the ruin they roll themselves in. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Terrors have turned on me. / They chase my honor as the wind. / My welfare has passed away as a cloud. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> "Now my soul is poured out within me. / Days of affliction have taken hold on me. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> In the night season my bones are pierced in me, / and the pains that gnaw me take no rest. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> By great force is my garment disfigured. / It binds me about as the collar of my coat. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> He has cast me into the mire. / I have become like dust and ashes. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> I cry to you, and you do not answer me. / I stand up, and you gaze at me. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> You have turned to be cruel to me. / With the might of your hand you persecute me. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> You lift me up to the wind, and drive me with it. / You dissolve me in the storm. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> For I know that you will bring me to death, / To the house appointed for all living. |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> "However doesn't one stretch out a hand in his fall? / Or in his calamity therefore cry for help? |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Didn't I weep for him who was in trouble? / Wasn't my soul grieved for the needy? |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> When I looked for good, then evil came; / When I waited for light, there came darkness. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> My heart is troubled, and doesn't rest. / Days of affliction have come on me. |</verse>
    <verse value="28"> I go mourning without the sun. / I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help. |</verse>
    <verse value="29"> I am a brother to jackals, / and a companion to ostriches. |</verse>
    <verse value="30"> My skin grows black and peels from me. / My bones are burned with heat. |</verse>
    <verse value="31"> Therefore my harp has turned to mourning, / and my pipe into the voice of those who weep. |</verse>
