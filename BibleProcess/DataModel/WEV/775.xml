    <verse value="1">The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Thus speaks Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying, Write all the words that I have spoken to you in a book.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will turn again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, says Yahweh; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> These are the words that Yahweh spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> For thus says Yahweh: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Ask now, and see whether a man does travail with child: why do I see every man with his hands on his waist, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> It shall come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Armies, that I will break his yoke from off your neck, and will burst your bonds; and strangers shall no more make him their bondservant;</verse>
    <verse value="9"> but they shall serve Yahweh their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up to them.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Therefore don't you be afraid, O Jacob my servant, says Yahweh; neither be dismayed, Israel: for, behold, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> For I am with you, says Yahweh, to save you: for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you, but I will not make a full end of you; but I will correct you in measure, and will in no way leave you unpunished.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> For thus says Yahweh, Your hurt is incurable, and your wound grievous.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> There is none to plead your cause, that you may be bound up: you have no healing medicines.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> All your lovers have forgotten you; they don't seek you: for I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins were increased.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Why do you cry for your hurt? Your pain is incurable: for the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins were increased, I have done these things to you.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Therefore all those who devour you shall be devoured; and all your adversaries, everyone of them, shall go into captivity; and those who despoil you shall be a spoil, and all who prey on you will I give for a prey.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> For I will restore health to you, and I will heal you of your wounds, says Yahweh; because they have called you an outcast, saying, It is Zion, whom no man seeks after.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Thus says Yahweh: Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have compassion on his dwelling places; and the city shall be built on its own hill, and the palace shall be inhabited in its own way.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of those who make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Their children also shall be as before, and their congregation shall be established before me; and I will punish all who oppress them.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from their midst; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach to me: for who is he who has had boldness to approach to me? says Yahweh.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> You shall be my people, and I will be your God.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Behold, the storm of Yahweh, his wrath, has gone forth, a sweeping storm: it shall burst on the head of the wicked.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> The fierce anger of Yahweh will not return, until he has executed, and until he has performed the intentions of his heart. In the latter days you will understand it. |</verse>
