    <verse value="1">Come near, you nations, to hear! / Listen, you peoples. / Let the earth and all it contains hear; / the world, and everything that comes from it. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> For Yahweh is enraged against all the nations, / and angry with all their armies. | He has utterly destroyed them. / He has given them over for slaughter. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Their slain will also be cast out, / and the stench of their dead bodies will come up; / and the mountains will melt in their blood. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> All of the army of the sky will be dissolved. / The sky will be rolled up like a scroll, / and all its armies will fade away, / as a leaf fades from off a vine or a fig tree. |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> For my sword has drunk its fill in the sky. / Behold, it will come down on Edom, / and on the people of my curse, for judgment. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Yahweh's sword is filled with blood. / It is covered with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, / with the fat of the kidneys of rams; / for Yahweh has a sacrifice in Bozrah, / And a great slaughter in the land of Edom. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> The wild oxen will come down with them, / and the young bulls with the mighty bulls; / and their land will be drunken with blood, / and their dust made greasy with fat. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> For Yahweh has a day of vengeance, / a year of recompense for the cause of Zion. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Its streams will be turned into pitch, / its dust into sulfur, / And its land will become burning pitch. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> It won't be quenched night nor day. / Its smoke will go up forever. / From generation to generation, it will lie waste. / No one will pass through it forever and ever. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> But the pelican and the porcupine will possess it. / The owl and the raven will dwell in it. | He will stretch the line of confusion over it, / and the plumb line of emptiness. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> They shall call its nobles to the kingdom, but none shall be there; / and all its princes shall be nothing. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Thorns will come up in its palaces, / nettles and thistles in its fortresses; / and it will be a habitation of jackals, / a court for ostriches. |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> The wild animals of the desert will meet with the wolves, / and the wild goat will cry to his fellow. | Yes, the night creature {literally, lilith, which could also be a night demon or night monster} shall settle there, / and shall find herself a place of rest. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> The arrow snake will make her nest there, / and lay, hatch, and gather under her shade. / Yes, the kites will be gathered there, every one with her mate. |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Search in the book of Yahweh, and read: / not one of these will be missing. / none will lack her mate. / For my mouth has commanded, / and his Spirit has gathered them. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> He has cast the lot for them, / and his hand has divided it to them with a measuring line. / They shall possess it forever. / From generation to generation they will dwell in it. |</verse>
