    <verse value="1">Don't boast about tomorrow; / for you don't know what a day may bring forth. |</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Let another man praise you, / and not your own mouth; / a stranger, and not your own lips. |</verse>
    <verse value="3"> A stone is heavy, / and sand is a burden; / but a fool's provocation is heavier than both. |</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Wrath is cruel, / and anger is overwhelming; / but who is able to stand before jealousy? |</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Better is open rebuke / than hidden love. |</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Faithful are the wounds of a friend; / although the kisses of an enemy are profuse. |</verse>
    <verse value="7"> A full soul loathes a honeycomb; / but to a hungry soul, every bitter thing is sweet. |</verse>
    <verse value="8"> As a bird that wanders from her nest, / so is a man who wanders from his home. |</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart; / so does earnest counsel from a man's friend. |</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Don't forsake your friend and your father's friend. / Don't go to your brother's house in the day of your disaster: / better is a neighbor who is near than a distant brother. |</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Be wise, my son, / and bring joy to my heart, / then I can answer my tormentor. |</verse>
    <verse value="12"> A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge; / but the simple pass on, and suffer for it. |</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Take his garment when he puts up collateral for a stranger. / Hold it for a wayward woman! |</verse>
    <verse value="14"> He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning, / it will be taken as a curse by him. |</verse>
    <verse value="15"> A continual dropping on a rainy day / and a contentious wife are alike: |</verse>
    <verse value="16"> restraining her is like restraining the wind, / or like grasping oil in his right hand. |</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Iron sharpens iron; / so a man sharpens his friend's countenance. |</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Whoever tends the fig tree shall eat its fruit. / He who looks after his master shall be honored. |</verse>
    <verse value="19"> As water reflects a face, / so a man's heart reflects the man. |</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Sheol {Sheol is the place of the dead.} and Abaddon are never satisfied; / and a man's eyes are never satisfied. |</verse>
    <verse value="21"> The crucible is for silver, / and the furnace for gold; / but man is refined by his praise. |</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain, / yet his foolishness will not be removed from him. |</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Know well the state of your flocks, / and pay attention to your herds: |</verse>
    <verse value="24"> for riches are not forever, / nor does even the crown endure to all generations. |</verse>
    <verse value="25"> The hay is removed, and the new growth appears, / the grasses of the hills are gathered in. |</verse>
    <verse value="26"> The lambs are for your clothing, / and the goats are the price of a field. |</verse>
    <verse value="27"> There will be plenty of goats' milk for your food, / for your family's food, / and for the nourishment of your servant girls. |</verse>
