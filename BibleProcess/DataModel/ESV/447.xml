    <verse value="1">Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Should a multitude of words go unanswered, and a man full of talk be judged right?</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Should your babble silence men, and when you mock, shall no one shame you?</verse>
    <verse value="4"> For you say, 'My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in God's eyes.'</verse>
    <verse value="5"> But oh, that God would speak and open his lips to you,</verse>
    <verse value="6"> and that he would tell you the secrets of wisdom! For he is manifold in understanding. Know then that God exacts of you less than your guilt deserves.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> "Can you find out the deep things of God? Can you find out the limit of the Almighty?</verse>
    <verse value="8"> It is higher than heaven--what can you do? Deeper than Sheol--what can you know?</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Its measure is longer than the earth and broader than the sea.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> If he passes through and imprisons and summons the court, who can turn him back?</verse>
    <verse value="11"> For he knows worthless men; when he sees iniquity, will he not consider it?</verse>
    <verse value="12"> But a stupid man will get understanding when a wild donkey's colt is born a man!</verse>
    <verse value="13"> "If you prepare your heart, you will stretch out your hands toward him.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, and let not injustice dwell in your tents.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Surely then you will lift up your face without blemish; you will be secure and will not fear.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> You will forget your misery; you will remember it as waters that have passed away.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> And your life will be brighter than the noonday; its darkness will be like the morning.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> And you will feel secure, because there is hope; you will look around and take your rest in security.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> You will lie down, and none will make you afraid; many will court your favor.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> But the eyes of the wicked will fail; all way of escape will be lost to them, and their hope is to breathe their last."</verse>
