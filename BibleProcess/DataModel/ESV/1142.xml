    <verse value="1">Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly place of holiness. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> For a tent was prepared, the first section, in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of the Presence. It is called the Holy Place. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Behind the second curtain was a second section called the Most Holy Place, </verse>
    <verse value="4"> having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden urn holding the manna, and Aaron's staff that budded, and the tablets of the covenant. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> These preparations having thus been made, the priests go regularly into the first section, performing their ritual duties, </verse>
    <verse value="7"> but into the second only the high priest goes, and he but once a year, and not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the unintentional sins of the people. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> By this the Holy Spirit indicates that the way into the holy places is not yet opened as long as the first section is still standing </verse>
    <verse value="9"> (which is symbolic for the present age). According to this arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper, </verse>
    <verse value="10"> but deal only with food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation) </verse>
    <verse value="12"> he entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of defiled persons with the ashes of a heifer, sanctify for the purification of the flesh, </verse>
    <verse value="14"> how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> For where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must be established.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> For a will takes effect only at death, since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> Therefore not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, </verse>
    <verse value="20"> saying, "This is the blood of the covenant that God commanded for you." </verse>
    <verse value="21"> And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Thus it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, </verse>
    <verse value="26"> for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment,</verse>
    <verse value="28"> so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.</verse>
