    <verse value="1">"Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Do you observe the calving of the does?</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Can you number the months that they fulfill, and do you know the time when they give birth,</verse>
    <verse value="3"> when they crouch, bring forth their offspring, and are delivered of their young?</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Their young ones become strong; they grow up in the open; they go out and do not return to them.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> "Who has let the wild donkey go free? Who has loosed the bonds of the swift donkey,</verse>
    <verse value="6"> to whom I have given the arid plain for his home and the salt land for his dwelling place?</verse>
    <verse value="7"> He scorns the tumult of the city; he hears not the shouts of the driver.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> He ranges the mountains as his pasture, and he searches after every green thing.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> "Is the wild ox willing to serve you? Will he spend the night at your manger?</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Can you bind him in the furrow with ropes, or will he harrow the valleys after you?</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Will you depend on him because his strength is great, and will you leave to him your labor?</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Do you have faith in him that he will return your grain and gather it to your threshing floor?</verse>
    <verse value="13"> "The wings of the ostrich wave proudly, but are they the pinions and plumage of love?</verse>
    <verse value="14"> For she leaves her eggs to the earth and lets them be warmed on the ground,</verse>
    <verse value="15"> forgetting that a foot may crush them and that the wild beast may trample them.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> She deals cruelly with her young, as if they were not hers; though her labor be in vain, yet she has no fear,</verse>
    <verse value="17"> because God has made her forget wisdom and given her no share in understanding.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> When she rouses herself to flee, she laughs at the horse and his rider.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> "Do you give the horse his might? Do you clothe his neck with a mane?</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Do you make him leap like the locust? His majestic snorting is terrifying.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> He paws in the valley and exults in his strength; he goes out to meet the weapons.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> He laughs at fear and is not dismayed; he does not turn back from the sword.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Upon him rattle the quiver, the flashing spear, and the javelin.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> With fierceness and rage he swallows the ground; he cannot stand still at the sound of the trumpet.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> When the trumpet sounds, he says 'Aha!' He smells the battle from afar, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> "Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars and spreads his wings toward the south?</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up and makes his nest on high?</verse>
    <verse value="28"> On the rock he dwells and makes his home, on the rocky crag and stronghold.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> From there he spies out the prey; his eyes behold it from far away.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> His young ones suck up blood, and where the slain are, there is he."</verse>
