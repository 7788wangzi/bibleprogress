    <verse value="1">[A Psalm of Asaph.] O God, the nations have come into your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple; they have laid Jerusalem in ruins.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> They have given the bodies of your servants to the birds of the heavens for food, the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> We have become a taunt to our neighbors, mocked and derided by those around us.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> How long, O LORD? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire?</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Pour out your anger on the nations that do not know you, and on the kingdoms that do not call upon your name!</verse>
    <verse value="7"> For they have devoured Jacob and laid waste his habitation.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Do not remember against us our former iniquities; let your compassion come speedily to meet us, for we are brought very low.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name; deliver us, and atone for our sins, for your name's sake!</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Let the avenging of the outpoured blood of your servants be known among the nations before our eyes!</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Let the groans of the prisoners come before you; according to your great power, preserve those doomed to die!</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Return sevenfold into the lap of our neighbors the taunts with which they have taunted you, O Lord!</verse>
    <verse value="13"> But we your people, the sheep of your pasture, will give thanks to you forever; from generation to generation we will recount your praise.</verse>
