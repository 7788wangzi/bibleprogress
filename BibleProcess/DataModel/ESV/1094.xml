    <verse value="1">O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith? </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh? </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Did you suffer so many things in vain--if indeed it was in vain? </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith--</verse>
    <verse value="6"> just as Abraham "believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness"?</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, "In you shall all the nations be blessed." </verse>
    <verse value="9"> So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, "Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the Book of the Law, and do them." </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for "The righteous shall live by faith." </verse>
    <verse value="12"> But the law is not of faith, rather "The one who does them shall live by them." </verse>
    <verse value="13"> Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us--for it is written, "Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree"-- </verse>
    <verse value="14"> so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> To give a human example, brothers: even with a man-made covenant, no one annuls it or adds to it once it has been ratified. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, "And to offsprings," referring to many, but referring to one, "And to your offspring," who is Christ. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> This is what I mean: the law, which came 430 years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring should come to whom the promise had been made, and it was put in place through angels by an intermediary. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> Now an intermediary implies more than one, but God is one.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Is the law then contrary to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could give life, then righteousness would indeed be by the law. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> But the Scripture imprisoned everything under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian,</verse>
    <verse value="26"> for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise.</verse>
