    <verse value="1">Now the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> And the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled, saying, "This man receives sinners and eats with them."</verse>
    <verse value="3"> So he told them this parable:</verse>
    <verse value="4"> "What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open country, and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it? </verse>
    <verse value="5"> And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.' </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> "Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it?</verse>
    <verse value="9"> And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.'</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Just so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents."</verse>
    <verse value="11"> And he said, "There was a man who had two sons.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> And the younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of property that is coming to me.' And he divided his property between them.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had and took a journey into a far country, and there he squandered his property in reckless living. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> And when he had spent everything, a severe famine arose in that country, and he began to be in need.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> And he was longing to be fed with the pods that the pigs ate, and no one gave him anything.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> "But when he came to himself, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have more than enough bread, but I perish here with hunger! </verse>
    <verse value="18"> I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Treat me as one of your hired servants."' </verse>
    <verse value="20"> And he arose and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.' </verse>
    <verse value="22"> But the father said to his servants, 'Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> And bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.' And they began to celebrate.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> "Now his older son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> And he said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and sound.'</verse>
    <verse value="28"> But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and entreated him,</verse>
    <verse value="29"> but he answered his father, 'Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might celebrate with my friends. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him!' </verse>
    <verse value="31"> And he said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. </verse>
    <verse value="32"> It was fitting to celebrate and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found.'"</verse>
