    <verse value="1">[A Psalm of David.] O LORD, I call upon you; hasten to me! Give ear to my voice when I call to you!</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Let my prayer be counted as incense before you, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice!</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; keep watch over the door of my lips!</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Do not let my heart incline to any evil, to busy myself with wicked deeds in company with men who work iniquity, and let me not eat of their delicacies!</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Let a righteous man strike me--it is a kindness; let him rebuke me--it is oil for my head; let my head not refuse it. Yet my prayer is continually against their evil deeds.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> When their judges are thrown over the cliff, then they shall hear my words, for they are pleasant.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> As when one plows and breaks up the earth, so shall our bones be scattered at the mouth of Sheol.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> But my eyes are toward you, O GOD, my Lord; in you I seek refuge; leave me not defenseless!</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Keep me from the trap that they have laid for me and from the snares of evildoers!</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by safely.</verse>
