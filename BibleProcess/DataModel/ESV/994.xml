    <verse value="1">Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the offering box, </verse>
    <verse value="2"> and he saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> And he said, "Truly, I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all of them. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on."</verse>
    <verse value="5"> And while some were speaking of the temple, how it was adorned with noble stones and offerings, he said, </verse>
    <verse value="6"> "As for these things that you see, the days will come when there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down." </verse>
    <verse value="7"> And they asked him, "Teacher, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?" </verse>
    <verse value="8"> And he said, "See that you are not led astray. For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he!' and, 'The time is at hand!' Do not go after them. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> And when you hear of wars and tumults, do not be terrified, for these things must first take place, but the end will not be at once."</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Then he said to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> There will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences. And there will be terrors and great signs from heaven. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> But before all this they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors for my name's sake. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> This will be your opportunity to bear witness. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> Settle it therefore in your minds not to meditate beforehand how to answer, </verse>
    <verse value="15"> for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> You will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and some of you they will put to death. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> You will be hated by all for my name's sake. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> But not a hair of your head will perish. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> By your endurance you will gain your lives.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> "But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are inside the city depart, and let not those who are out in the country enter it,</verse>
    <verse value="22"> for these are days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> Alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! For there will be great distress upon the earth and wrath against this people. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive among all nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> "And there will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity because of the roaring of the sea and the waves, </verse>
    <verse value="26"> people fainting with fear and with foreboding of what is coming on the world. For the powers of the heavens will be shaken. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> Now when these things begin to take place, straighten up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near."</verse>
    <verse value="29"> And he told them a parable: "Look at the fig tree, and all the trees.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> As soon as they come out in leaf, you see for yourselves and know that the summer is already near. </verse>
    <verse value="31"> So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that the kingdom of God is near.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all has taken place. </verse>
    <verse value="33"> Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> "But watch yourselves lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of this life, and that day come upon you suddenly like a trap. </verse>
    <verse value="35"> For it will come upon all who dwell on the face of the whole earth.</verse>
    <verse value="36"> But stay awake at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man."</verse>
    <verse value="37"> And every day he was teaching in the temple, but at night he went out and lodged on the mount called Olivet. </verse>
    <verse value="38"> And early in the morning all the people came to him in the temple to hear him.</verse>
