    <verse value="1">[To the choirmaster. Of David, the servant of the LORD.] Transgression speaks to the wicked deep in his heart; there is no fear of God before his eyes.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> For he flatters himself in his own eyes that his iniquity cannot be found out and hated.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> The words of his mouth are trouble and deceit; he has ceased to act wisely and do good.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> He plots trouble while on his bed; he sets himself in a way that is not good; he does not reject evil.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Your steadfast love, O LORD, extends to the heavens, your faithfulness to the clouds.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Your righteousness is like the mountains of God; your judgments are like the great deep; man and beast you save, O LORD.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> How precious is your steadfast love, O God! The children of mankind take refuge in the shadow of your wings.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> They feast on the abundance of your house, and you give them drink from the river of your delights.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> For with you is the fountain of life; in your light do we see light.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Oh, continue your steadfast love to those who know you, and your righteousness to the upright of heart!</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Let not the foot of arrogance come upon me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> There the evildoers lie fallen; they are thrust down, unable to rise.</verse>
