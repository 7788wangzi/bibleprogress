    <verse value="1">And he said to them, "Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God after it has come with power."</verse>
    <verse value="2"> And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. And he was transfigured before them, </verse>
    <verse value="3"> and his clothes became radiant, intensely white, as no one on earth could bleach them. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> And Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah." </verse>
    <verse value="6"> For he did not know what to say, for they were terrified. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> And a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, "This is my beloved Son; listen to him." </verse>
    <verse value="8"> And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus only.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> And as they were coming down the mountain, he charged them to tell no one what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what this rising from the dead might mean. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> And they asked him, "Why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?" </verse>
    <verse value="12"> And he said to them, "Elijah does come first to restore all things. And how is it written of the Son of Man that he should suffer many things and be treated with contempt? </verse>
    <verse value="13"> But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they pleased, as it is written of him."</verse>
    <verse value="14"> And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> And immediately all the crowd, when they saw him, were greatly amazed and ran up to him and greeted him.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> And he asked them, "What are you arguing about with them?"</verse>
    <verse value="17"> And someone from the crowd answered him, "Teacher, I brought my son to you, for he has a spirit that makes him mute. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> And whenever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid. So I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able." </verse>
    <verse value="19"> And he answered them, "O faithless generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me." </verse>
    <verse value="20"> And they brought the boy to him. And when the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> And Jesus asked his father, "How long has this been happening to him?" And he said, "From childhood.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> And it has often cast him into fire and into water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us." </verse>
    <verse value="23"> And Jesus said to him, "'If you can'! All things are possible for one who believes." </verse>
    <verse value="24"> Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, "I believe; help my unbelief!" </verse>
    <verse value="25"> And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, "You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter him again." </verse>
    <verse value="26"> And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, it came out, and the boy was like a corpse, so that most of them said, "He is dead." </verse>
    <verse value="27"> But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> And when he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, "Why could we not cast it out?" </verse>
    <verse value="29"> And he said to them, "This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer."</verse>
    <verse value="30"> They went on from there and passed through Galilee. And he did not want anyone to know, </verse>
    <verse value="31"> for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And when he is killed, after three days he will rise."</verse>
    <verse value="32"> But they did not understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.</verse>
    <verse value="33"> And they came to Capernaum. And when he was in the house he asked them, "What were you discussing on the way?" </verse>
    <verse value="34"> But they kept silent, for on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest. </verse>
    <verse value="35"> And he sat down and called the twelve. And he said to them, "If anyone would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all." </verse>
    <verse value="36"> And he took a child and put him in the midst of them, and taking him in his arms, he said to them, </verse>
    <verse value="37"> "Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me."</verse>
    <verse value="38"> John said to him, "Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he was not following us."</verse>
    <verse value="39"> But Jesus said, "Do not stop him, for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me.</verse>
    <verse value="40"> For the one who is not against us is for us. </verse>
    <verse value="41"> For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ will by no means lose his reward.</verse>
    <verse value="42"> "Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea. </verse>
    <verse value="43"> And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than with two hands to go to hell, to the unquenchable fire. </verse>
    <verse value="44">
    </verse>
    <verse value="45"> And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell. </verse>
    <verse value="46">
    </verse>
    <verse value="47"> And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell, </verse>
    <verse value="48"> 'where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.' </verse>
    <verse value="49"> For everyone will be salted with fire. </verse>
    <verse value="50"> Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, how will you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another."</verse>
