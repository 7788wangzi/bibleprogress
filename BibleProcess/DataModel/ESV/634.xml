    <verse value="1">My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, have given your pledge for a stranger,</verse>
    <verse value="2"> if you are snared in the words of your mouth, caught in the words of your mouth,</verse>
    <verse value="3"> then do this, my son, and save yourself, for you have come into the hand of your neighbor: go, hasten, and plead urgently with your neighbor.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Give your eyes no sleep and your eyelids no slumber;</verse>
    <verse value="5"> save yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the hand of the fowler.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Go to the ant, O sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Without having any chief, officer, or ruler,</verse>
    <verse value="8"> she prepares her bread in summer and gathers her food in harvest.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> How long will you lie there, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep?</verse>
    <verse value="10"> A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,</verse>
    <verse value="11"> and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> A worthless person, a wicked man, goes about with crooked speech,</verse>
    <verse value="13"> winks with his eyes, signals with his feet, points with his finger,</verse>
    <verse value="14"> with perverted heart devises evil, continually sowing discord;</verse>
    <verse value="15"> therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in a moment he will be broken beyond healing.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are an abomination to him:</verse>
    <verse value="17"> haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</verse>
    <verse value="18"> a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil,</verse>
    <verse value="19"> a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Bind them on your heart always; tie them around your neck.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life,</verse>
    <verse value="24"> to preserve you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Do not desire her beauty in your heart, and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes;</verse>
    <verse value="26"> for the price of a prostitute is only a loaf of bread, but a married woman hunts down a precious life.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Can a man carry fire next to his chest and his clothes not be burned?</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Or can one walk on hot coals and his feet not be scorched?</verse>
    <verse value="29"> So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife; none who touches her will go unpunished.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his appetite when he is hungry,</verse>
    <verse value="31"> but if he is caught, he will pay sevenfold; he will give all the goods of his house.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> He who commits adultery lacks sense; he who does it destroys himself.</verse>
    <verse value="33"> He will get wounds and dishonor, and his disgrace will not be wiped away.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> For jealousy makes a man furious, and he will not spare when he takes revenge.</verse>
    <verse value="35"> He will accept no compensation; he will refuse though you multiply gifts.</verse>
