    <verse value="1">[To the choirmaster: according to Do Not Destroy. A Miktam of David.] Do you indeed decree what is right, you gods? Do you judge the children of man uprightly?</verse>
    <verse value="2"> No, in your hearts you devise wrongs; your hands deal out violence on earth.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray from birth, speaking lies.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> They have venom like the venom of a serpent, like the deaf adder that stops its ear,</verse>
    <verse value="5"> so that it does not hear the voice of charmers or of the cunning enchanter.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> O God, break the teeth in their mouths; tear out the fangs of the young lions, O LORD!</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Let them vanish like water that runs away; when he aims his arrows, let them be blunted.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Let them be like the snail that dissolves into slime, like the stillborn child who never sees the sun.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Sooner than your pots can feel the heat of thorns, whether green or ablaze, may he sweep them away!</verse>
    <verse value="10"> The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Mankind will say, "Surely there is a reward for the righteous; surely there is a God who judges on earth."</verse>
