    <verse value="1">Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?</verse>
    <verse value="2"> The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and against his Anointed, saying,</verse>
    <verse value="3"> "Let us burst their bonds apart and cast away their cords from us."</verse>
    <verse value="4"> He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord holds them in derision.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying,</verse>
    <verse value="6"> "As for me, I have set my King on Zion, my holy hill."</verse>
    <verse value="7"> I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, "You are my Son; today I have begotten you.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> You shall break them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Now therefore, O kings, be wise; be warned, O rulers of the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.</verse>
