    <verse value="1">Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> For if anyone thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> But let each one test his own work, and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> For each will have to bear his own load.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> One who is taught the word must share all good things with the one who teaches. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to those who are of the household of faith.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh who would force you to be circumcised, and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> For even those who are circumcised do not themselves keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> For neither circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> And as for all who walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.</verse>
