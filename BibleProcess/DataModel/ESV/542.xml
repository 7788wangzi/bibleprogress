    <verse value="1">[To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.] Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint; preserve my life from dread of the enemy.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Hide me from the secret plots of the wicked, from the throng of evildoers,</verse>
    <verse value="3"> who whet their tongues like swords, who aim bitter words like arrows,</verse>
    <verse value="4"> shooting from ambush at the blameless, shooting at him suddenly and without fear.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> They hold fast to their evil purpose; they talk of laying snares secretly, thinking, "Who can see them?"</verse>
    <verse value="6"> They search out injustice, saying, "We have accomplished a diligent search." For the inward mind and heart of a man are deep!</verse>
    <verse value="7"> But God shoots his arrow at them; they are wounded suddenly.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> They are brought to ruin, with their own tongues turned against them; all who see them will wag their heads.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Then all mankind fears; they tell what God has brought about and ponder what he has done.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Let the righteous one rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in him! Let all the upright in heart exult!</verse>
