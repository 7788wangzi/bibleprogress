    <verse value="1">I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> As a lily among brambles, so is my love among the young women.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> As an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my beloved among the young men. With great delight I sat in his shadow, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Sustain me with raisins; refresh me with apples, for I am sick with love.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me!</verse>
    <verse value="7"> I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or the does of the field, that you not stir up or awaken love until it pleases.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> The voice of my beloved! Behold, he comes, leaping over the mountains, bounding over the hills.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, there he stands behind our wall, gazing through the windows, looking through the lattice.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> My beloved speaks and says to me: "Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come away,</verse>
    <verse value="11"> for behold, the winter is past; the rain is over and gone.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> The flowers appear on the earth, the time of singing has come, and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> The fig tree ripens its figs, and the vines are in blossom; they give forth fragrance. Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the crannies of the cliff, let me see your face, let me hear your voice, for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Catch the foxes for us, the little foxes that spoil the vineyards, for our vineyards are in blossom."</verse>
    <verse value="16"> My beloved is mine, and I am his; he grazes among the lilies.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Until the day breathes and the shadows flee, turn, my beloved, be like a gazelle or a young stag on cleft mountains.</verse>
