    <verse value="1">"Has not man a hard service on earth, and are not his days like the days of a hired hand?</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Like a slave who longs for the shadow, and like a hired hand who looks for his wages,</verse>
    <verse value="3"> so I am allotted months of emptiness, and nights of misery are apportioned to me.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> When I lie down I say, 'When shall I arise?' But the night is long, and I am full of tossing till the dawn.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> My flesh is clothed with worms and dirt; my skin hardens, then breaks out afresh.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle and come to their end without hope.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> "Remember that my life is a breath; my eye will never again see good.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> The eye of him who sees me will behold me no more; while your eyes are on me, I shall be gone.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> As the cloud fades and vanishes, so he who goes down to Sheol does not come up;</verse>
    <verse value="10"> he returns no more to his house, nor does his place know him anymore.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> "Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Am I the sea, or a sea monster, that you set a guard over me?</verse>
    <verse value="13"> When I say, 'My bed will comfort me, my couch will ease my complaint,'</verse>
    <verse value="14"> then you scare me with dreams and terrify me with visions,</verse>
    <verse value="15"> so that I would choose strangling and death rather than my bones.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> I loathe my life; I would not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are a breath.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> What is man, that you make so much of him, and that you set your heart on him,</verse>
    <verse value="18"> visit him every morning and test him every moment?</verse>
    <verse value="19"> How long will you not look away from me, nor leave me alone till I swallow my spit?</verse>
    <verse value="20"> If I sin, what do I do to you, you watcher of mankind? Why have you made me your mark? Why have I become a burden to you?</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Why do you not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity? For now I shall lie in the earth; you will seek me, but I shall not be."</verse>
