    <verse value="1">Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is no trouble to me and is safe for you.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Look out for the dogs, look out for the evildoers, look out for those who mutilate the flesh. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> For we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh-- </verse>
    <verse value="4"> though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also. If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more: </verse>
    <verse value="5"> circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; </verse>
    <verse value="6"> as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ </verse>
    <verse value="9"> and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith-- </verse>
    <verse value="10"> that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, </verse>
    <verse value="11"> that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, </verse>
    <verse value="14"> I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Let those of us who are mature think this way, and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal that also to you. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> Only let us hold true to what we have attained.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Brothers, join in imitating me, and keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example you have in us. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> For many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, walk as enemies of the cross of Christ. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, </verse>
    <verse value="21"> who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.</verse>
