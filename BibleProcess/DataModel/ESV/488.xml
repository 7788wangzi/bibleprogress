    <verse value="1">Why, O LORD, do you stand far away? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?</verse>
    <verse value="2"> In arrogance the wicked hotly pursue the poor; let them be caught in the schemes that they have devised.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For the wicked boasts of the desires of his soul, and the one greedy for gain curses and renounces the LORD.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> In the pride of his face the wicked does not seek him; all his thoughts are, "There is no God."</verse>
    <verse value="5"> His ways prosper at all times; your judgments are on high, out of his sight; as for all his foes, he puffs at them.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> He says in his heart, "I shall not be moved; throughout all generations I shall not meet adversity."</verse>
    <verse value="7"> His mouth is filled with cursing and deceit and oppression; under his tongue are mischief and iniquity.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> He sits in ambush in the villages; in hiding places he murders the innocent. His eyes stealthily watch for the helpless;</verse>
    <verse value="9"> he lurks in ambush like a lion in his thicket; he lurks that he may seize the poor; he seizes the poor when he draws him into his net.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> The helpless are crushed, sink down, and fall by his might.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> He says in his heart, "God has forgotten, he has hidden his face, he will never see it."</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up your hand; forget not the afflicted.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Why does the wicked renounce God and say in his heart, "You will not call to account"?</verse>
    <verse value="14"> But you do see, for you note mischief and vexation, that you may take it into your hands; to you the helpless commits himself; you have been the helper of the fatherless.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Break the arm of the wicked and evildoer; call his wickedness to account till you find none.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> The LORD is king forever and ever; the nations perish from his land.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> O LORD, you hear the desire of the afflicted; you will strengthen their heart; you will incline your ear</verse>
    <verse value="18"> to do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed, so that man who is of the earth may strike terror no more.</verse>
