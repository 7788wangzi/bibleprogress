    <verse value="1">I wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness. Do bear with me!</verse>
    <verse value="2"> For I feel a divine jealousy for you, since I betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it readily enough. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Indeed, I consider that I am not in the least inferior to these super-apostles. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Even if I am unskilled in speaking, I am not so in knowledge; indeed, in every way we have made this plain to you in all things.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached God's gospel to you free of charge?</verse>
    <verse value="8"> I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> And when I was with you and was in need, I did not burden anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my need. So I refrained and will refrain from burdening you in any way. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> And why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!</verse>
    <verse value="12"> And what I do I will continue to do, in order to undermine the claim of those who would like to claim that in their boasted mission they work on the same terms as we do. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> I repeat, let no one think me foolish. But even if you do, accept me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> What I am saying with this boastful confidence, I say not with the Lord's authority but as a fool. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> Since many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> For you gladly bear with fools, being wise yourselves! </verse>
    <verse value="20"> For you bear it if someone makes slaves of you, or devours you, or takes advantage of you, or puts on airs, or strikes you in the face.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> To my shame, I must say, we were too weak for that! But whatever anyone else dares to boast of--I am speaking as a fool--I also dare to boast of that. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they offspring of Abraham? So am I. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> Are they servants of Christ? I am a better one--I am talking like a madman--with far greater labors, far more imprisonments, with countless beatings, and often near death. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> Five times I received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes less one. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I was adrift at sea; </verse>
    <verse value="26"> on frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from my own people, danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brothers; </verse>
    <verse value="27"> in toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> And, apart from other things, there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for all the churches. </verse>
    <verse value="29"> Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to fall, and I am not indignant?</verse>
    <verse value="30"> If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness. </verse>
    <verse value="31"> The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying. </verse>
    <verse value="32"> At Damascus, the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of Damascus in order to seize me, </verse>
    <verse value="33"> but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands.</verse>
