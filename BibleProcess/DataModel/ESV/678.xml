    <verse value="1">How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O noble daughter! Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of a master hand.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Your navel is a rounded bowl that never lacks mixed wine. Your belly is a heap of wheat, encircled with lilies.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Your nose is like a tower of Lebanon, which looks toward Damascus.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Your head crowns you like Carmel, and your flowing locks are like purple; a king is held captive in the tresses.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> How beautiful and pleasant you are, O loved one, with all your delights!</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts are like its clusters.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> I say I will climb the palm tree and lay hold of its fruit. Oh may your breasts be like clusters of the vine, and the scent of your breath like apples,</verse>
    <verse value="9"> and your mouth like the best wine. It goes down smoothly for my beloved, gliding over lips and teeth.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> I am my beloved's, and his desire is for me.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Come, my beloved, let us go out into the fields and lodge in the villages;</verse>
    <verse value="12"> let us go out early to the vineyards and see whether the vines have budded, whether the grape blossoms have opened and the pomegranates are in bloom. There I will give you my love.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> The mandrakes give forth fragrance, and beside our doors are all choice fruits, new as well as old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved.</verse>
