    <verse value="1">Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, </verse>
    <verse value="2"> and of instruction about washings, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> And this we will do if God permits. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> For it is impossible, in the case of those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have shared in the Holy Spirit, </verse>
    <verse value="5"> and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come, </verse>
    <verse value="6"> and then have fallen away, to restore them again to repentance, since they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding him up to contempt. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> For land that has drunk the rain that often falls on it, and produces a crop useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed, and its end is to be burned.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Though we speak in this way, yet in your case, beloved, we feel sure of better things--things that belong to salvation.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> For God is not unjust so as to overlook your work and the love that you have shown for his name in serving the saints, as you still do. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance of hope until the end, </verse>
    <verse value="12"> so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself,</verse>
    <verse value="14"> saying, "Surely I will bless you and multiply you." </verse>
    <verse value="15"> And thus Abraham, having patiently waited, obtained the promise. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> For people swear by something greater than themselves, and in all their disputes an oath is final for confirmation.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he guaranteed it with an oath, </verse>
    <verse value="18"> so that by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain, </verse>
    <verse value="20"> where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
