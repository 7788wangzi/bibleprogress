    <verse value="1">Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Therefore my thoughts answer me, because of my haste within me.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> I hear censure that insults me, and out of my understanding a spirit answers me.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Do you not know this from of old, since man was placed on earth,</verse>
    <verse value="5"> that the exulting of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless but for a moment?</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Though his height mount up to the heavens, and his head reach to the clouds,</verse>
    <verse value="7"> he will perish forever like his own dung; those who have seen him will say, 'Where is he?'</verse>
    <verse value="8"> He will fly away like a dream and not be found; he will be chased away like a vision of the night.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> The eye that saw him will see him no more, nor will his place any more behold him.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> His children will seek the favor of the poor, and his hands will give back his wealth.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> His bones are full of his youthful vigor, but it will lie down with him in the dust.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> "Though evil is sweet in his mouth, though he hides it under his tongue,</verse>
    <verse value="13"> though he is loath to let it go and holds it in his mouth,</verse>
    <verse value="14"> yet his food is turned in his stomach; it is the venom of cobras within him.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> He swallows down riches and vomits them up again; God casts them out of his belly.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> He will suck the poison of cobras; the tongue of a viper will kill him.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> He will not look upon the rivers, the streams flowing with honey and curds.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> He will give back the fruit of his toil and will not swallow it down; from the profit of his trading he will get no enjoyment.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> For he has crushed and abandoned the poor; he has seized a house that he did not build.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> "Because he knew no contentment in his belly, he will not let anything in which he delights escape him.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> There was nothing left after he had eaten; therefore his prosperity will not endure.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> In the fullness of his sufficiency he will be in distress; the hand of everyone in misery will come against him.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> To fill his belly to the full, God will send his burning anger against him and rain it upon him into his body.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> He will flee from an iron weapon; a bronze arrow will strike him through.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> It is drawn forth and comes out of his body; the glittering point comes out of his gallbladder; terrors come upon him.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Utter darkness is laid up for his treasures; a fire not fanned will devour him; what is left in his tent will be consumed.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> The heavens will reveal his iniquity, and the earth will rise up against him.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> The possessions of his house will be carried away, dragged off in the day of God's wrath.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> This is the wicked man's portion from God, the heritage decreed for him by God."</verse>
