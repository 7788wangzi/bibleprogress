    <verse value="1">And the LORD said to Moses, "See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> You shall speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron shall tell Pharaoh to let the people of Israel go out of his land. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and though I multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Pharaoh will not listen to you. Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and bring my hosts, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> The Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring out the people of Israel from among them." </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Moses and Aaron did so; they did just as the LORD commanded them.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Now Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,</verse>
    <verse value="9"> "When Pharaoh says to you, 'Prove yourselves by working a miracle,' then you shall say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it may become a serpent.'" </verse>
    <verse value="10"> So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the LORD commanded. Aaron cast down his staff before Pharaoh and his servants, and it became a serpent.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Then Pharaoh summoned the wise men and the sorcerers, and they, the magicians of Egypt, also did the same by their secret arts. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> For each man cast down his staff, and they became serpents. But Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Still Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is hardened; he refuses to let the people go.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Go to Pharaoh in the morning, as he is going out to the water. Stand on the bank of the Nile to meet him, and take in your hand the staff that turned into a serpent. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> And you shall say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to you, saying, "Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness. But so far, you have not obeyed." </verse>
    <verse value="17"> Thus says the LORD, "By this you shall know that I am the LORD: behold, with the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water that is in the Nile, and it shall turn into blood. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> The fish in the Nile shall die, and the Nile will stink, and the Egyptians will grow weary of drinking water from the Nile."'" </verse>
    <verse value="19"> And the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, their canals, and their ponds, and all their pools of water, so that they may become blood, and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, even in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.'"</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded. In the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants he lifted up the staff and struck the water in the Nile, and all the water in the Nile turned into blood. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> And the fish in the Nile died, and the Nile stank, so that the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile. There was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> But the magicians of Egypt did the same by their secret arts. So Pharaoh's heart remained hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the LORD had said. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he did not take even this to heart.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile for water to drink, for they could not drink the water of the Nile.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Seven full days passed after the LORD had struck the Nile.</verse>
