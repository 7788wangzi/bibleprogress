    <verse value="1">Oh give thanks to the LORD; call upon his name; make known his deeds among the peoples!</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Sing to him, sing praises to him; tell of all his wondrous works!</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice!</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Seek the LORD and his strength; seek his presence continually!</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Remember the wondrous works that he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he uttered,</verse>
    <verse value="6"> O offspring of Abraham, his servant, children of Jacob, his chosen ones!</verse>
    <verse value="7"> He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> He remembers his covenant forever, the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations,</verse>
    <verse value="9"> the covenant that he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac,</verse>
    <verse value="10"> which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant,</verse>
    <verse value="11"> saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan as your portion for an inheritance."</verse>
    <verse value="12"> When they were few in number, of little account, and sojourners in it,</verse>
    <verse value="13"> wandering from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people,</verse>
    <verse value="14"> he allowed no one to oppress them; he rebuked kings on their account,</verse>
    <verse value="15"> saying, "Touch not my anointed ones, do my prophets no harm!"</verse>
    <verse value="16"> When he summoned a famine on the land and broke all supply of bread,</verse>
    <verse value="17"> he had sent a man ahead of them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> His feet were hurt with fetters; his neck was put in a collar of iron;</verse>
    <verse value="19"> until what he had said came to pass, the word of the LORD tested him.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> The king sent and released him; the ruler of the peoples set him free;</verse>
    <verse value="21"> he made him lord of his house and ruler of all his possessions,</verse>
    <verse value="22"> to bind his princes at his pleasure and to teach his elders wisdom.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Then Israel came to Egypt; Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> And the LORD made his people very fruitful and made them stronger than their foes.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> He turned their hearts to hate his people, to deal craftily with his servants.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> He sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> They performed his signs among them and miracles in the land of Ham.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> He sent darkness, and made the land dark; they did not rebel against his words.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> He turned their waters into blood and caused their fish to die.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their kings.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> He gave them hail for rain, and fiery lightning bolts through their land.</verse>
    <verse value="33"> He struck down their vines and fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> He spoke, and the locusts came, young locusts without number,</verse>
    <verse value="35"> which devoured all the vegetation in their land and ate up the fruit of their ground.</verse>
    <verse value="36"> He struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their strength.</verse>
    <verse value="37"> Then he brought out Israel with silver and gold, and there was none among his tribes who stumbled.</verse>
    <verse value="38"> Egypt was glad when they departed, for dread of them had fallen upon it.</verse>
    <verse value="39"> He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light by night.</verse>
    <verse value="40"> They asked, and he brought quail, and gave them bread from heaven in abundance.</verse>
    <verse value="41"> He opened the rock, and water gushed out; it flowed through the desert like a river.</verse>
    <verse value="42"> For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham, his servant.</verse>
    <verse value="43"> So he brought his people out with joy, his chosen ones with singing.</verse>
    <verse value="44"> And he gave them the lands of the nations, and they took possession of the fruit of the peoples' toil,</verse>
    <verse value="45"> that they might keep his statutes and observe his laws. Praise the LORD!</verse>
