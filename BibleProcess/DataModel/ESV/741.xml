    <verse value="1">For Zion's sake I will not keep silent, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not be quiet, until her righteousness goes forth as brightness, and her salvation as a burning torch.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> The nations shall see your righteousness, and all the kings your glory, and you shall be called by a new name that the mouth of the LORD will give.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> You shall be a crown of beauty in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> You shall no more be termed Forsaken, and your land shall no more be termed Desolate, but you shall be called My Delight Is in Her, and your land Married; for the LORD delights in you, and your land shall be married.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> For as a young man marries a young woman, so shall your sons marry you, and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have set watchmen; all the day and all the night they shall never be silent. You who put the LORD in remembrance, take no rest,</verse>
    <verse value="7"> and give him no rest until he establishes Jerusalem and makes it a praise in the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> The LORD has sworn by his right hand and by his mighty arm: "I will not again give your grain to be food for your enemies, and foreigners shall not drink your wine for which you have labored;</verse>
    <verse value="9"> but those who garner it shall eat it and praise the LORD, and those who gather it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary."</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Go through, go through the gates; prepare the way for the people; build up, build up the highway; clear it of stones; lift up a signal over the peoples.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Behold, the LORD has proclaimed to the end of the earth: Say to the daughter of Zion, "Behold, your salvation comes; behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him."</verse>
    <verse value="12"> And they shall be called The Holy People, The Redeemed of the LORD; and you shall be called Sought Out, A City Not Forsaken.</verse>
