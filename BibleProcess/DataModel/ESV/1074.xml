    <verse value="1">Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> You know that when you were pagans you were led astray to mute idols, however you were led. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says "Jesus is accursed!" and no one can say "Jesus is Lord" except in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; </verse>
    <verse value="5"> and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord; </verse>
    <verse value="6"> and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> For to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit, </verse>
    <verse value="9"> to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, </verse>
    <verse value="10"> to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as he wills.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body--Jews or Greeks, slaves or free--and all were made to drink of one Spirit.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> For the body does not consist of one member but of many.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> If the foot should say, "Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body," that would not make it any less a part of the body.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> And if the ear should say, "Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body," that would not make it any less a part of the body.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> If the whole body were an eye, where would be the sense of hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell?</verse>
    <verse value="18"> But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> If all were a single member, where would the body be?</verse>
    <verse value="20"> As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> The eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you," nor again the head to the feet, "I have no need of you."</verse>
    <verse value="22"> On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,</verse>
    <verse value="23"> and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty,</verse>
    <verse value="24"> which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it,</verse>
    <verse value="25"> that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, administrating, and various kinds of tongues. </verse>
    <verse value="29"> Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?</verse>
    <verse value="31"> But earnestly desire the higher gifts. And I will show you a still more excellent way.</verse>
