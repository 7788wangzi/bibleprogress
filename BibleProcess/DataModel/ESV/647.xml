    <verse value="1">Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity than one who is crooked in speech and is a fool.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Desire without knowledge is not good, and whoever makes haste with his feet misses his way.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> When a man's folly brings his way to ruin, his heart rages against the LORD.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Wealth brings many new friends, but a poor man is deserted by his friend.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> A false witness will not go unpunished, and he who breathes out lies will not escape.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Many seek the favor of a generous man, and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> All a poor man's brothers hate him; how much more do his friends go far from him! He pursues them with words, but does not have them.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Whoever gets sense loves his own soul; he who keeps understanding will discover good.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> A false witness will not go unpunished, and he who breathes out lies will perish.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury, much less for a slave to rule over princes.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Good sense makes one slow to anger, and it is his glory to overlook an offense.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> A king's wrath is like the growling of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> A foolish son is ruin to his father, and a wife's quarreling is a continual dripping of rain.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> House and wealth are inherited from fathers, but a prudent wife is from the LORD.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep, and an idle person will suffer hunger.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Whoever keeps the commandment keeps his life; he who despises his ways will die.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the LORD, and he will repay him for his deed.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Discipline your son, for there is hope; do not set your heart on putting him to death.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> A man of great wrath will pay the penalty, for if you deliver him, you will only have to do it again.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Listen to advice and accept instruction, that you may gain wisdom in the future.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the LORD that will stand.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> What is desired in a man is steadfast love, and a poor man is better than a liar.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> The fear of the LORD leads to life, and whoever has it rests satisfied; he will not be visited by harm.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> The sluggard buries his hand in the dish and will not even bring it back to his mouth.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Strike a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; reprove a man of understanding, and he will gain knowledge.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> He who does violence to his father and chases away his mother is a son who brings shame and reproach.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Cease to hear instruction, my son, and you will stray from the words of knowledge.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> A worthless witness mocks at justice, and the mouth of the wicked devours iniquity.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Condemnation is ready for scoffers, and beating for the backs of fools.</verse>
