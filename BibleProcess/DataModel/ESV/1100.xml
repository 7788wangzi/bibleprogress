    <verse value="1">For this reason I, Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles-- </verse>
    <verse value="2"> assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace that was given to me for you, </verse>
    <verse value="3"> how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I have written briefly. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> When you read this, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ,</verse>
    <verse value="5"> which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> This mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God's grace, which was given me by the working of his power. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, </verse>
    <verse value="9"> and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things, </verse>
    <verse value="10"> so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, </verse>
    <verse value="12"> in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> So I ask you not to lose heart over what I am suffering for you, which is your glory.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> For this reason I bow my knees before the Father,</verse>
    <verse value="15"> from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, </verse>
    <verse value="16"> that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being,</verse>
    <verse value="17"> so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith--that you, being rooted and grounded in love, </verse>
    <verse value="18"> may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, </verse>
    <verse value="19"> and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, </verse>
    <verse value="21"> to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
