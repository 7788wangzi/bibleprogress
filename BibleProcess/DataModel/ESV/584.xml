    <verse value="1">Praise the LORD! Oh give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever!</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Who can utter the mighty deeds of the LORD, or declare all his praise?</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Blessed are they who observe justice, who do righteousness at all times!</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Remember me, O LORD, when you show favor to your people; help me when you save them,</verse>
    <verse value="5"> that I may look upon the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory with your inheritance.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Both we and our fathers have sinned; we have committed iniquity; we have done wickedness.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Our fathers, when they were in Egypt, did not consider your wondrous works; they did not remember the abundance of your steadfast love, but rebelled by the sea, at the Red Sea.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Yet he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make known his mighty power.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> He rebuked the Red Sea, and it became dry, and he led them through the deep as through a desert.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> So he saved them from the hand of the foe and redeemed them from the power of the enemy.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> And the waters covered their adversaries; not one of them was left.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Then they believed his words; they sang his praise.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> But they soon forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> But they had a wanton craving in the wilderness, and put God to the test in the desert;</verse>
    <verse value="15"> he gave them what they asked, but sent a wasting disease among them.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> When men in the camp were jealous of Moses and Aaron, the holy one of the LORD,</verse>
    <verse value="17"> the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Fire also broke out in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> They made a calf in Horeb and worshiped a metal image.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> They exchanged the glory of God for the image of an ox that eats grass.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,</verse>
    <verse value="22"> wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Therefore he said he would destroy them-- had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him, to turn away his wrath from destroying them.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Then they despised the pleasant land, having no faith in his promise.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> They murmured in their tents, and did not obey the voice of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them that he would make them fall in the wilderness,</verse>
    <verse value="27"> and would make their offspring fall among the nations, scattering them among the lands.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Then they yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor, and ate sacrifices offered to the dead;</verse>
    <verse value="29"> they provoked the LORD to anger with their deeds, and a plague broke out among them.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was stayed.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> And that was counted to him as righteousness from generation to generation forever.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> They angered him at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses on their account,</verse>
    <verse value="33"> for they made his spirit bitter, and he spoke rashly with his lips.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> They did not destroy the peoples, as the LORD commanded them,</verse>
    <verse value="35"> but they mixed with the nations and learned to do as they did.</verse>
    <verse value="36"> They served their idols, which became a snare to them.</verse>
    <verse value="37"> They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons;</verse>
    <verse value="38"> they poured out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was polluted with blood.</verse>
    <verse value="39"> Thus they became unclean by their acts, and played the whore in their deeds.</verse>
    <verse value="40"> Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against his people, and he abhorred his heritage;</verse>
    <verse value="41"> he gave them into the hand of the nations, so that those who hated them ruled over them.</verse>
    <verse value="42"> Their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their power.</verse>
    <verse value="43"> Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious in their purposes and were brought low through their iniquity.</verse>
    <verse value="44"> Nevertheless, he looked upon their distress, when he heard their cry.</verse>
    <verse value="45"> For their sake he remembered his covenant, and relented according to the abundance of his steadfast love.</verse>
    <verse value="46"> He caused them to be pitied by all those who held them captive.</verse>
    <verse value="47"> Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.</verse>
    <verse value="48"> Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! And let all the people say, "Amen!" Praise the LORD!</verse>
