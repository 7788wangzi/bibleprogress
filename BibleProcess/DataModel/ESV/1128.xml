    <verse value="1">But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, </verse>
    <verse value="3"> heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, </verse>
    <verse value="4"> treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, </verse>
    <verse value="5"> having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions,</verse>
    <verse value="7"> always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, as was that of those two men.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> You, however, have followed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness, </verse>
    <verse value="11"> my persecutions and sufferings that happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra--which persecutions I endured; yet from them all the Lord rescued me. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, </verse>
    <verse value="13"> while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it </verse>
    <verse value="15"> and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, </verse>
    <verse value="17"> that the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work.</verse>
