    <verse value="1">[To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet went to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.] Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin!</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you may be justified in your words and blameless in your judgment.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Behold, you delight in truth in the inward being, and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones that you have broken rejoice.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Hide your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Cast me not away from your presence, and take not your Holy Spirit from me.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will return to you.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, O God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> For you will not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it; you will not be pleased with a burnt offering.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Do good to Zion in your good pleasure; build up the walls of Jerusalem;</verse>
    <verse value="19"> then will you delight in right sacrifices, in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on your altar.</verse>
