    <verse value="1">[A Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the LORD concerning the words of Cush, a Benjaminite.] O LORD my God, in you do I take refuge; save me from all my pursuers and deliver me,</verse>
    <verse value="2"> lest like a lion they tear my soul apart, rending it in pieces, with none to deliver.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> O LORD my God, if I have done this, if there is wrong in my hands,</verse>
    <verse value="4"> if I have repaid my friend with evil or plundered my enemy without cause,</verse>
    <verse value="5"> let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it, and let him trample my life to the ground and lay my glory in the dust. Selah</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Arise, O LORD, in your anger; lift yourself up against the fury of my enemies; awake for me; you have appointed a judgment.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Let the assembly of the peoples be gathered about you; over it return on high.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> The LORD judges the peoples; judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and according to the integrity that is in me.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Oh, let the evil of the wicked come to an end, and may you establish the righteous-- you who test the minds and hearts, O righteous God!</verse>
    <verse value="10"> My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> God is a righteous judge, and a God who feels indignation every day.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> If a man does not repent, God will whet his sword; he has bent and readied his bow;</verse>
    <verse value="13"> he has prepared for him his deadly weapons, making his arrows fiery shafts.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Behold, the wicked man conceives evil and is pregnant with mischief and gives birth to lies.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> He makes a pit, digging it out, and falls into the hole that he has made.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> His mischief returns upon his own head, and on his own skull his violence descends.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> I will give to the LORD the thanks due to his righteousness, and I will sing praise to the name of the LORD, the Most High.</verse>
