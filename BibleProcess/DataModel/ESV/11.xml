    <verse value="3"> And they said to one another, "Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly." And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Then they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth." </verse>
    <verse value="5"> And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of man had built.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> And the LORD said, "Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another's speech." </verse>
    <verse value="8"> So the LORD dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth. And from there the LORD dispersed them over the face of all the earth.</verse>
