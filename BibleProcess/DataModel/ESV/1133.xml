    <verse value="1">Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved fellow worker </verse>
    <verse value="2"> and Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier, and the church in your house:</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers, </verse>
    <verse value="5"> because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints, </verse>
    <verse value="6"> and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required, </verse>
    <verse value="9"> yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you--I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus-- </verse>
    <verse value="10"> I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I became in my imprisonment. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> (Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.)</verse>
    <verse value="12"> I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel, </verse>
    <verse value="14"> but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own accord. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> For this perhaps is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever, </verse>
    <verse value="16"> no longer as a slave but more than a slave, as a beloved brother--especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it--to say nothing of your owing me even your own self.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you, </verse>
    <verse value="24"> and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</verse>
