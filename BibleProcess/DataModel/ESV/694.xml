    <verse value="1">An oracle concerning Moab. Because Ar of Moab is laid waste in a night, Moab is undone; because Kir of Moab is laid waste in a night, Moab is undone.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> He has gone up to the temple, and to Dibon, to the high places to weep; over Nebo and over Medeba Moab wails. On every head is baldness; every beard is shorn;</verse>
    <verse value="3"> in the streets they wear sackcloth; on the housetops and in the squares everyone wails and melts in tears.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Heshbon and Elealeh cry out; their voice is heard as far as Jahaz; therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud; his soul trembles.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> My heart cries out for Moab; her fugitives flee to Zoar, to Eglath-shelishiyah. For at the ascent of Luhith they go up weeping; on the road to Horonaim they raise a cry of destruction;</verse>
    <verse value="6"> the waters of Nimrim are a desolation; the grass is withered, the vegetation fails, the greenery is no more.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Therefore the abundance they have gained and what they have laid up they carry away over the Brook of the Willows.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> For a cry has gone around the land of Moab; her wailing reaches to Eglaim; her wailing reaches to Beer-elim.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> For the waters of Dibon are full of blood; for I will bring upon Dibon even more, a lion for those of Moab who escape, for the remnant of the land.</verse>
