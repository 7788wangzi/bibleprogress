    <verse value="1">My son, keep my words and treasure up my commandments with you;</verse>
    <verse value="2"> keep my commandments and live; keep my teaching as the apple of your eye;</verse>
    <verse value="3"> bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," and call insight your intimate friend,</verse>
    <verse value="5"> to keep you from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> For at the window of my house I have looked out through my lattice,</verse>
    <verse value="7"> and I have seen among the simple, I have perceived among the youths, a young man lacking sense,</verse>
    <verse value="8"> passing along the street near her corner, taking the road to her house</verse>
    <verse value="9"> in the twilight, in the evening, at the time of night and darkness.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> And behold, the woman meets him, dressed as a prostitute, wily of heart.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> She is loud and wayward; her feet do not stay at home;</verse>
    <verse value="12"> now in the street, now in the market, and at every corner she lies in wait.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> She seizes him and kisses him, and with bold face she says to him,</verse>
    <verse value="14"> "I had to offer sacrifices, and today I have paid my vows;</verse>
    <verse value="15"> so now I have come out to meet you, to seek you eagerly, and I have found you.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> I have spread my couch with coverings, colored linens from Egyptian linen;</verse>
    <verse value="17"> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Come, let us take our fill of love till morning; let us delight ourselves with love.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey;</verse>
    <verse value="20"> he took a bag of money with him; at full moon he will come home."</verse>
    <verse value="21"> With much seductive speech she persuades him; with her smooth talk she compels him.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> All at once he follows her, as an ox goes to the slaughter, or as a stag is caught fast</verse>
    <verse value="23"> till an arrow pierces its liver; as a bird rushes into a snare; he does not know that it will cost him his life.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> And now, O sons, listen to me, and be attentive to the words of my mouth.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Let not your heart turn aside to her ways; do not stray into her paths,</verse>
    <verse value="26"> for many a victim has she laid low, and all her slain are a mighty throng.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death.</verse>
