    <verse value="1">If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> On account of these the wrath of God is coming. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> In these you too once walked, when you were living in them. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices </verse>
    <verse value="10"> and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all, and in all.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, </verse>
    <verse value="13"> bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body. And be thankful. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Slaves, obey in everything those who are your earthly masters, not by way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, </verse>
    <verse value="24"> knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> For the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality.</verse>
