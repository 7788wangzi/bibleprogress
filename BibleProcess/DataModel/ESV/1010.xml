    <verse value="1">Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> During supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him, </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going back to God, </verse>
    <verse value="4"> rose from supper. He laid aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, tied it around his waist. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, do you wash my feet?"</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Jesus answered him, "What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand." </verse>
    <verse value="8"> Peter said to him, "You shall never wash my feet." Jesus answered him, "If I do not wash you, you have no share with me." </verse>
    <verse value="9"> Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!"</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Jesus said to him, "The one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not every one of you." </verse>
    <verse value="11"> For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, "Not all of you are clean."</verse>
    <verse value="12"> When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, "Do you understand what I have done to you? </verse>
    <verse value="13"> You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> I am not speaking of all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But the Scripture will be fulfilled, 'He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.' </verse>
    <verse value="19"> I am telling you this now, before it takes place, that when it does take place you may believe that I am he. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever receives the one I send receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me."</verse>
    <verse value="21"> After saying these things, Jesus was troubled in his spirit, and testified, "Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me." </verse>
    <verse value="22"> The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining at table close to Jesus, </verse>
    <verse value="24"> so Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking. </verse>
    <verse value="25"> So that disciple, leaning back against Jesus, said to him, "Lord, who is it?"</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Jesus answered, "It is he to whom I will give this morsel of bread when I have dipped it." So when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> Then after he had taken the morsel, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, "What you are going to do, do quickly." </verse>
    <verse value="28"> Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Some thought that, because Judas had the moneybag, Jesus was telling him, "Buy what we need for the feast," or that he should give something to the poor. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> So, after receiving the morsel of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> When he had gone out, Jesus said, "Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him. </verse>
    <verse value="32"> If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once. </verse>
    <verse value="33"> Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and just as I said to the Jews, so now I also say to you, 'Where I am going you cannot come.' </verse>
    <verse value="34"> A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. </verse>
    <verse value="35"> By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."</verse>
    <verse value="36"> Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, where are you going?" Jesus answered him, "Where I am going you cannot follow me now, but you will follow afterward." </verse>
    <verse value="37"> Peter said to him, "Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you." </verse>
    <verse value="38"> Jesus answered, "Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster will not crow till you have denied me three times.</verse>
