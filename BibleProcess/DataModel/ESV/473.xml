    <verse value="1">"At this also my heart trembles and leaps out of its place.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Keep listening to the thunder of his voice and the rumbling that comes from his mouth.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Under the whole heaven he lets it go, and his lightning to the corners of the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> After it his voice roars; he thunders with his majestic voice, and he does not restrain the lightnings when his voice is heard.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> God thunders wondrously with his voice; he does great things that we cannot comprehend.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> For to the snow he says, 'Fall on the earth,' likewise to the downpour, his mighty downpour.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> He seals up the hand of every man, that all men whom he made may know it.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Then the beasts go into their lairs, and remain in their dens.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> From its chamber comes the whirlwind, and cold from the scattering winds.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> By the breath of God ice is given, and the broad waters are frozen fast.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> He loads the thick cloud with moisture; the clouds scatter his lightning.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> They turn around and around by his guidance, to accomplish all that he commands them on the face of the habitable world.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Whether for correction or for his land or for love, he causes it to happen.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> "Hear this, O Job; stop and consider the wondrous works of God.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Do you know how God lays his command upon them and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine?</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Do you know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge,</verse>
    <verse value="17"> you whose garments are hot when the earth is still because of the south wind?</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Can you, like him, spread out the skies, hard as a cast metal mirror?</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Teach us what we shall say to him; we cannot draw up our case because of darkness.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Shall it be told him that I would speak? Did a man ever wish that he would be swallowed up?</verse>
    <verse value="21"> "And now no one looks on the light when it is bright in the skies, when the wind has passed and cleared them.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Out of the north comes golden splendor; God is clothed with awesome majesty.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> The Almighty--we cannot find him; he is great in power; justice and abundant righteousness he will not violate.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Therefore men fear him; he does not regard any who are wise in their own conceit."</verse>
