    <verse value="1">[To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David, the servant of the LORD, who addressed the words of this song to the LORD on the day when the LORD rescued him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. He said:] I love you, O LORD, my strength.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, and I am saved from my enemies.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> The cords of death encompassed me; the torrents of destruction assailed me;</verse>
    <verse value="5"> the cords of Sheol entangled me; the snares of death confronted me.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> In my distress I called upon the LORD; to my God I cried for help. From his temple he heard my voice, and my cry to him reached his ears.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Then the earth reeled and rocked; the foundations also of the mountains trembled and quaked, because he was angry.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Smoke went up from his nostrils, and devouring fire from his mouth; glowing coals flamed forth from him.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> He bowed the heavens and came down; thick darkness was under his feet.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> He rode on a cherub and flew; he came swiftly on the wings of the wind.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him, thick clouds dark with water.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Out of the brightness before him hailstones and coals of fire broke through his clouds.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice, hailstones and coals of fire.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> And he sent out his arrows and scattered them; he flashed forth lightnings and routed them.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Then the channels of the sea were seen, and the foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> He sent from on high, he took me; he drew me out of many waters.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> He rescued me from my strong enemy and from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> They confronted me in the day of my calamity, but the LORD was my support.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> He brought me out into a broad place; he rescued me, because he delighted in me.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> The LORD dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he rewarded me.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> For all his rules were before me, and his statutes I did not put away from me.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> I was blameless before him, and I kept myself from my guilt.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> So the LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> With the merciful you show yourself merciful; with the blameless man you show yourself blameless;</verse>
    <verse value="26"> with the purified you show yourself pure; and with the crooked you make yourself seem tortuous.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> For you save a humble people, but the haughty eyes you bring down.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> For it is you who light my lamp; the LORD my God lightens my darkness.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> For by you I can run against a troop, and by my God I can leap over a wall.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> This God--his way is perfect; the word of the LORD proves true; he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> For who is God, but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our God?--</verse>
    <verse value="32"> the God who equipped me with strength and made my way blameless.</verse>
    <verse value="33"> He made my feet like the feet of a deer and set me secure on the heights.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.</verse>
    <verse value="35"> You have given me the shield of your salvation, and your right hand supported me, and your gentleness made me great.</verse>
    <verse value="36"> You gave a wide place for my steps under me, and my feet did not slip.</verse>
    <verse value="37"> I pursued my enemies and overtook them, and did not turn back till they were consumed.</verse>
    <verse value="38"> I thrust them through, so that they were not able to rise; they fell under my feet.</verse>
    <verse value="39"> For you equipped me with strength for the battle; you made those who rise against me sink under me.</verse>
    <verse value="40"> You made my enemies turn their backs to me, and those who hated me I destroyed.</verse>
    <verse value="41"> They cried for help, but there was none to save; they cried to the LORD, but he did not answer them.</verse>
    <verse value="42"> I beat them fine as dust before the wind; I cast them out like the mire of the streets.</verse>
    <verse value="43"> You delivered me from strife with the people; you made me the head of the nations; people whom I had not known served me.</verse>
    <verse value="44"> As soon as they heard of me they obeyed me; foreigners came cringing to me.</verse>
    <verse value="45"> Foreigners lost heart and came trembling out of their fortresses.</verse>
    <verse value="46"> The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock, and exalted be the God of my salvation--</verse>
    <verse value="47"> the God who gave me vengeance and subdued peoples under me,</verse>
    <verse value="48"> who delivered me from my enemies; yes, you exalted me above those who rose against me; you rescued me from the man of violence.</verse>
    <verse value="49"> For this I will praise you, O LORD, among the nations, and sing to your name.</verse>
    <verse value="50"> Great salvation he brings to his king, and shows steadfast love to his anointed, to David and his offspring forever.</verse>
