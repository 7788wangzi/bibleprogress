    <verse value="1">[To the choirmaster. Of David.] In the LORD I take refuge; how can you say to my soul, "Flee like a bird to your mountain,</verse>
    <verse value="2"> for behold, the wicked bend the bow; they have fitted their arrow to the string to shoot in the dark at the upright in heart;</verse>
    <verse value="3"> if the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?"</verse>
    <verse value="4"> The LORD is in his holy temple; the LORD's throne is in heaven; his eyes see, his eyelids test the children of man.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> The LORD tests the righteous, but his soul hates the wicked and the one who loves violence.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Let him rain coals on the wicked; fire and sulfur and a scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> For the LORD is righteous; he loves righteous deeds; the upright shall behold his face.</verse>
