    <verse value="1">Comfort, comfort my people, says your God.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and cry to her that her warfare is ended, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she has received from the LORD's hand double for all her sins.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> A voice cries: "In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low; the uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together, for the mouth of the LORD has spoken."</verse>
    <verse value="6"> A voice says, "Cry!" And I said, "What shall I cry?" All flesh is grass, and all its beauty is like the flower of the field.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> The grass withers, the flower fades when the breath of the LORD blows on it; surely the people are grass.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand forever.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Get you up to a high mountain, O Zion, herald of good news; lift up your voice with strength, O Jerusalem, herald of good news; lift it up, fear not; say to the cities of Judah, "Behold your God!"</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Behold, the Lord GOD comes with might, and his arm rules for him; behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> He will tend his flock like a shepherd; he will gather the lambs in his arms; he will carry them in his bosom, and gently lead those that are with young.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and marked off the heavens with a span, enclosed the dust of the earth in a measure and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance?</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Who has measured the Spirit of the LORD, or what man shows him his counsel?</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Whom did he consult, and who made him understand? Who taught him the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and showed him the way of understanding?</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and are accounted as the dust on the scales; behold, he takes up the coastlands like fine dust.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Lebanon would not suffice for fuel, nor are its beasts enough for a burnt offering.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> All the nations are as nothing before him, they are accounted by him as less than nothing and emptiness.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> To whom then will you liken God, or what likeness compare with him?</verse>
    <verse value="19"> An idol! A craftsman casts it, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold and casts for it silver chains.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> He who is too impoverished for an offering chooses wood that will not rot; he seeks out a skillful craftsman to set up an idol that will not move.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Do you not know? Do you not hear? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?</verse>
    <verse value="22"> It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them like a tent to dwell in;</verse>
    <verse value="23"> who brings princes to nothing, and makes the rulers of the earth as emptiness.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Scarcely are they planted, scarcely sown, scarcely has their stem taken root in the earth, when he blows on them, and they wither, and the tempest carries them off like stubble.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> To whom then will you compare me, that I should be like him? says the Holy One.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Lift up your eyes on high and see: who created these? He who brings out their host by number, calling them all by name, by the greatness of his might, and because he is strong in power not one is missing.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Why do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, "My way is hidden from the LORD, and my right is disregarded by my God"?</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Have you not known? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary; his understanding is unsearchable.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> He gives power to the faint, and to him who has no might he increases strength.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Even youths shall faint and be weary, and young men shall fall exhausted;</verse>
    <verse value="31"> but they who wait for the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint.</verse>
