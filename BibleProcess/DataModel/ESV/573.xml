    <verse value="1">Oh come, let us sing to the LORD; let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation!</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving; let us make a joyful noise to him with songs of praise!</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> In his hand are the depths of the earth; the heights of the mountains are his also.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> The sea is his, for he made it, and his hands formed the dry land.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Oh come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the LORD, our Maker!</verse>
    <verse value="7"> For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. Today, if you hear his voice,</verse>
    <verse value="8"> do not harden your hearts, as at Meribah, as on the day at Massah in the wilderness,</verse>
    <verse value="9"> when your fathers put me to the test and put me to the proof, though they had seen my work.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> For forty years I loathed that generation and said, "They are a people who go astray in their heart, and they have not known my ways."</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Therefore I swore in my wrath, "They shall not enter my rest."</verse>
