    <verse value="1">And Elihu answered and said:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Do you think this to be just? Do you say, 'It is my right before God,'</verse>
    <verse value="3"> that you ask, 'What advantage have I? How am I better off than if I had sinned?'</verse>
    <verse value="4"> I will answer you and your friends with you.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Look at the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds, which are higher than you.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against him? And if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?</verse>
    <verse value="7"> If you are righteous, what do you give to him? Or what does he receive from your hand?</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Your wickedness concerns a man like yourself, and your righteousness a son of man.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> "Because of the multitude of oppressions people cry out; they call for help because of the arm of the mighty.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> But none says, 'Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,</verse>
    <verse value="11"> who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?'</verse>
    <verse value="12"> There they cry out, but he does not answer, because of the pride of evil men.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Surely God does not hear an empty cry, nor does the Almighty regard it.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> How much less when you say that you do not see him, that the case is before him, and you are waiting for him!</verse>
    <verse value="15"> And now, because his anger does not punish, and he does not take much note of transgression,</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Job opens his mouth in empty talk; he multiplies words without knowledge."</verse>
