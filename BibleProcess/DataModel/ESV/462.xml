    <verse value="1">Then Job answered and said:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "How you have helped him who has no power! How you have saved the arm that has no strength!</verse>
    <verse value="3"> How you have counseled him who has no wisdom, and plentifully declared sound knowledge!</verse>
    <verse value="4"> With whose help have you uttered words, and whose breath has come out from you?</verse>
    <verse value="5"> The dead tremble under the waters and their inhabitants.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> He stretches out the north over the void and hangs the earth on nothing.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not split open under them.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> He covers the face of the full moon and spreads over it his cloud.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> He has inscribed a circle on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> The pillars of heaven tremble and are astounded at his rebuke.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> By his power he stilled the sea; by his understanding he shattered Rahab.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> By his wind the heavens were made fair; his hand pierced the fleeing serpent.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways, and how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?"</verse>
