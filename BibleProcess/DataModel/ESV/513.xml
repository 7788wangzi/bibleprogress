    <verse value="1">[Of David.] Contend, O LORD, with those who contend with me; fight against those who fight against me!</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Take hold of shield and buckler and rise for my help!</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Draw the spear and javelin against my pursuers! Say to my soul, "I am your salvation!"</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Let them be put to shame and dishonor who seek after my life! Let them be turned back and disappointed who devise evil against me!</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Let them be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the LORD driving them away!</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Let their way be dark and slippery, with the angel of the LORD pursuing them!</verse>
    <verse value="7"> For without cause they hid their net for me; without cause they dug a pit for my life.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Let destruction come upon him when he does not know it! And let the net that he hid ensnare him; let him fall into it--to his destruction!</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Then my soul will rejoice in the LORD, exulting in his salvation.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> All my bones shall say, "O LORD, who is like you, delivering the poor from him who is too strong for him, the poor and needy from him who robs him?"</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Malicious witnesses rise up; they ask me of things that I do not know.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> They repay me evil for good; my soul is bereft.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> But I, when they were sick-- I wore sackcloth; I afflicted myself with fasting; I prayed with head bowed on my chest.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> I went about as though I grieved for my friend or my brother; as one who laments his mother, I bowed down in mourning.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> But at my stumbling they rejoiced and gathered; they gathered together against me; wretches whom I did not know tore at me without ceasing;</verse>
    <verse value="16"> like profane mockers at a feast, they gnash at me with their teeth.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> How long, O Lord, will you look on? Rescue me from their destruction, my precious life from the lions!</verse>
    <verse value="18"> I will thank you in the great congregation; in the mighty throng I will praise you.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Let not those rejoice over me who are wrongfully my foes, and let not those wink the eye who hate me without cause.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> For they do not speak peace, but against those who are quiet in the land they devise words of deceit.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> They open wide their mouths against me; they say, "Aha, Aha! Our eyes have seen it!"</verse>
    <verse value="22"> You have seen, O LORD; be not silent! O Lord, be not far from me!</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Awake and rouse yourself for my vindication, for my cause, my God and my Lord!</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Vindicate me, O LORD, my God, according to your righteousness, and let them not rejoice over me!</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Let them not say in their hearts, "Aha, our heart's desire!" Let them not say, "We have swallowed him up."</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Let them be put to shame and disappointed altogether who rejoice at my calamity! Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves against me!</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Let those who delight in my righteousness shout for joy and be glad and say evermore, "Great is the LORD, who delights in the welfare of his servant!"</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Then my tongue shall tell of your righteousness and of your praise all the day long.</verse>
