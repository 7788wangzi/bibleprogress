    <verse value="1">Bel bows down; Nebo stoops; their idols are on beasts and livestock; these things you carry are borne as burdens on weary beasts.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> They stoop; they bow down together; they cannot save the burden, but themselves go into captivity.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> "Listen to me, O house of Jacob, all the remnant of the house of Israel, who have been borne by me from before your birth, carried from the womb;</verse>
    <verse value="4"> even to your old age I am he, and to gray hairs I will carry you. I have made, and I will bear; I will carry and will save.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> "To whom will you liken me and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be alike?</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Those who lavish gold from the purse, and weigh out silver in the scales, hire a goldsmith, and he makes it into a god; then they fall down and worship!</verse>
    <verse value="7"> They lift it to their shoulders, they carry it, they set it in its place, and it stands there; it cannot move from its place. If one cries to it, it does not answer or save him from his trouble.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> "Remember this and stand firm, recall it to mind, you transgressors,</verse>
    <verse value="9"> remember the former things of old; for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me,</verse>
    <verse value="10"> declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, 'My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose,'</verse>
    <verse value="11"> calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country. I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass; I have purposed, and I will do it.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> "Listen to me, you stubborn of heart, you who are far from righteousness:</verse>
    <verse value="13"> I bring near my righteousness; it is not far off, and my salvation will not delay; I will put salvation in Zion, for Israel my glory."</verse>
