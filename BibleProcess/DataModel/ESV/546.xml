    <verse value="2"> As smoke is driven away, so you shall drive them away; as wax melts before fire, so the wicked shall perish before God!</verse>
    <verse value="3"> But the righteous shall be glad; they shall exult before God; they shall be jubilant with joy!</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Sing to God, sing praises to his name; lift up a song to him who rides through the deserts; his name is the LORD; exult before him!</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Father of the fatherless and protector of widows is God in his holy habitation.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> God settles the solitary in a home; he leads out the prisoners to prosperity, but the rebellious dwell in a parched land.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> O God, when you went out before your people, when you marched through the wilderness, Selah</verse>
    <verse value="8"> the earth quaked, the heavens poured down rain, before God, the One of Sinai, before God, the God of Israel.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Rain in abundance, O God, you shed abroad; you restored your inheritance as it languished;</verse>
    <verse value="10"> your flock found a dwelling in it; in your goodness, O God, you provided for the needy.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> The Lord gives the word; the women who announce the news are a great host:</verse>
    <verse value="12"> "The kings of the armies--they flee, they flee!" The women at home divide the spoil--</verse>
    <verse value="13"> though you men lie among the sheepfolds-- the wings of a dove covered with silver, its pinions with shimmering gold.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> When the Almighty scatters kings there, let snow fall on Zalmon.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> O mountain of God, mountain of Bashan; O many-peaked mountain, mountain of Bashan!</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Why do you look with hatred, O many-peaked mountain, at the mount that God desired for his abode, yes, where the LORD will dwell forever?</verse>
    <verse value="17"> The chariots of God are twice ten thousand, thousands upon thousands; the Lord is among them; Sinai is now in the sanctuary.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> You ascended on high, leading a host of captives in your train and receiving gifts among men, even among the rebellious, that the LORD God may dwell there.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears us up; God is our salvation. Selah</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Our God is a God of salvation, and to GOD, the Lord, belong deliverances from death.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> But God will strike the heads of his enemies, the hairy crown of him who walks in his guilty ways.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> The Lord said, "I will bring them back from Bashan, I will bring them back from the depths of the sea,</verse>
    <verse value="23"> that you may strike your feet in their blood, that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from the foe."</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Your procession is seen, O God, the procession of my God, my King, into the sanctuary--</verse>
    <verse value="25"> the singers in front, the musicians last, between them virgins playing tambourines:</verse>
    <verse value="26"> "Bless God in the great congregation, the LORD, O you who are of Israel's fountain!"</verse>
    <verse value="27"> There is Benjamin, the least of them, in the lead, the princes of Judah in their throng, the princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Summon your power, O God, the power, O God, by which you have worked for us.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Because of your temple at Jerusalem kings shall bear gifts to you.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Rebuke the beasts that dwell among the reeds, the herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples. Trample underfoot those who lust after tribute; scatter the peoples who delight in war.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> Nobles shall come from Egypt; Cush shall hasten to stretch out her hands to God.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> O kingdoms of the earth, sing to God; sing praises to the Lord, Selah</verse>
    <verse value="33"> to him who rides in the heavens, the ancient heavens; behold, he sends out his voice, his mighty voice.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> Ascribe power to God, whose majesty is over Israel, and whose power is in the skies.</verse>
    <verse value="35"> Awesome is God from his sanctuary; the God of Israel--he is the one who gives power and strength to his people. Blessed be God!</verse>
