    <verse value="1">[A Song of Ascents.] Remember, O LORD, in David's favor, all the hardships he endured,</verse>
    <verse value="2"> how he swore to the LORD and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob,</verse>
    <verse value="3"> "I will not enter my house or get into my bed,</verse>
    <verse value="4"> I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids,</verse>
    <verse value="5"> until I find a place for the LORD, a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob."</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah; we found it in the fields of Jaar.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> "Let us go to his dwelling place; let us worship at his footstool!"</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Arise, O LORD, and go to your resting place, you and the ark of your might.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Let your priests be clothed with righteousness, and let your saints shout for joy.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> For the sake of your servant David, do not turn away the face of your anointed one.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> The LORD swore to David a sure oath from which he will not turn back: "One of the sons of your body I will set on your throne.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> If your sons keep my covenant and my testimonies that I shall teach them, their sons also forever shall sit on your throne."</verse>
    <verse value="13"> For the LORD has chosen Zion; he has desired it for his dwelling place:</verse>
    <verse value="14"> "This is my resting place forever; here I will dwell, for I have desired it.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> I will abundantly bless her provisions; I will satisfy her poor with bread.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Her priests I will clothe with salvation, and her saints will shout for joy.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> There I will make a horn to sprout for David; I have prepared a lamp for my anointed.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> His enemies I will clothe with shame, but on him his crown will shine."</verse>
