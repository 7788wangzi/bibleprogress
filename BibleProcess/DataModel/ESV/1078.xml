    <verse value="1">Now concerning the collection for the saints: as I directed the churches of Galatia, so you also are to do. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> On the first day of every week, each of you is to put something aside and store it up, as he may prosper, so that there will be no collecting when I come. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> And when I arrive, I will send those whom you accredit by letter to carry your gift to Jerusalem. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> If it seems advisable that I should go also, they will accompany me.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> I will visit you after passing through Macedonia, for I intend to pass through Macedonia, </verse>
    <verse value="6"> and perhaps I will stay with you or even spend the winter, so that you may help me on my journey, wherever I go. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> For I do not want to see you now just in passing. I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, </verse>
    <verse value="9"> for a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> When Timothy comes, see that you put him at ease among you, for he is doing the work of the Lord, as I am. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> So let no one despise him. Help him on his way in peace, that he may return to me, for I am expecting him with the brothers.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers, but it was not at all his will to come now. He will come when he has opportunity.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> Let all that you do be done in love.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Now I urge you, brothers--you know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints-- </verse>
    <verse value="16"> be subject to such as these, and to every fellow worker and laborer. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have made up for your absence, </verse>
    <verse value="18"> for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours. Give recognition to such men.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> The churches of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Prisca, together with the church in their house, send you hearty greetings in the Lord. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> All the brothers send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed. Our Lord, come!</verse>
    <verse value="23"> The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.</verse>
