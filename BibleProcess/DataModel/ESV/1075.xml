    <verse value="1">If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant </verse>
    <verse value="5"> or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; </verse>
    <verse value="6"> it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> For we know in part and we prophesy in part, </verse>
    <verse value="10"> but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.</verse>
