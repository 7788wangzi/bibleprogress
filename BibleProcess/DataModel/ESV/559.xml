    <verse value="1">[To the choirmaster: according to The Gittith. Of Asaph.] Sing aloud to God our strength; shout for joy to the God of Jacob!</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Raise a song; sound the tambourine, the sweet lyre with the harp.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the full moon, on our feast day.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> For it is a statute for Israel, a rule of the God of Jacob.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> He made it a decree in Joseph when he went out over the land of Egypt. I hear a language I had not known:</verse>
    <verse value="6"> "I relieved your shoulder of the burden; your hands were freed from the basket.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> In distress you called, and I delivered you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Hear, O my people, while I admonish you! O Israel, if you would but listen to me!</verse>
    <verse value="9"> There shall be no strange god among you; you shall not bow down to a foreign god.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> I am the LORD your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> "But my people did not listen to my voice; Israel would not submit to me.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts, to follow their own counsels.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Oh, that my people would listen to me, that Israel would walk in my ways!</verse>
    <verse value="14"> I would soon subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their foes.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Those who hate the LORD would cringe toward him, and their fate would last forever.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> But he would feed you with the finest of the wheat, and with honey from the rock I would satisfy you."</verse>
