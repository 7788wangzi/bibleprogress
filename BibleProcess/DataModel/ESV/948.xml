    <verse value="1">Now when Jesus had finished these sayings, he went away from Galilee and entered the region of Judea beyond the Jordan. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> And large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> And Pharisees came up to him and tested him by asking, "Is it lawful to divorce one's wife for any cause?" </verse>
    <verse value="4"> He answered, "Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, </verse>
    <verse value="5"> and said, 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'? </verse>
    <verse value="6"> So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate." </verse>
    <verse value="7"> They said to him, "Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?" </verse>
    <verse value="8"> He said to them, "Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery."</verse>
    <verse value="10"> The disciples said to him, "If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry."</verse>
    <verse value="11"> But he said to them, "Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it."</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Then children were brought to him that he might lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked the people, </verse>
    <verse value="14"> but Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven." </verse>
    <verse value="15"> And he laid his hands on them and went away.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> And behold, a man came up to him, saying, "Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?" </verse>
    <verse value="17"> And he said to him, "Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments." </verse>
    <verse value="18"> He said to him, "Which ones?" And Jesus said, "You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, </verse>
    <verse value="19"> Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself." </verse>
    <verse value="20"> The young man said to him, "All these I have kept. What do I still lack?"</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Jesus said to him, "If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me." </verse>
    <verse value="22"> When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> And Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God." </verse>
    <verse value="25"> When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, "Who then can be saved?"</verse>
    <verse value="26"> But Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible." </verse>
    <verse value="27"> Then Peter said in reply, "See, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?" </verse>
    <verse value="28"> Jesus said to them, "Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. </verse>
    <verse value="29"> And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> But many who are first will be last, and the last first.</verse>
