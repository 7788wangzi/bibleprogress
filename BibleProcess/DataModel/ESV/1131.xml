    <verse value="13"> waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, </verse>
    <verse value="14"> who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works.</verse>
