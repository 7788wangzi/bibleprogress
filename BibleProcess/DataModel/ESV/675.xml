    <verse value="1">Behold, you are beautiful, my love, behold, you are beautiful! Your eyes are doves behind your veil. Your hair is like a flock of goats leaping down the slopes of Gilead.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes that have come up from the washing, all of which bear twins, and not one among them has lost its young.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Your lips are like a scarlet thread, and your mouth is lovely. Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Your neck is like the tower of David, built in rows of stone; on it hang a thousand shields, all of them shields of warriors.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, that graze among the lilies.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Until the day breathes and the shadows flee, I will go away to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> You are altogether beautiful, my love; there is no flaw in you.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Come with me from Lebanon, my bride; come with me from Lebanon. Depart from the peak of Amana, from the peak of Senir and Hermon, from the dens of lions, from the mountains of leopards.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> You have captivated my heart, my sister, my bride; you have captivated my heart with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride! How much better is your love than wine, and the fragrance of your oils than any spice!</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Your lips drip nectar, my bride; honey and milk are under your tongue; the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> A garden locked is my sister, my bride, a spring locked, a fountain sealed.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates with all choicest fruits, henna with nard,</verse>
    <verse value="14"> nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense, myrrh and aloes, with all choice spices--</verse>
    <verse value="15"> a garden fountain, a well of living water, and flowing streams from Lebanon.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Awake, O north wind, and come, O south wind! Blow upon my garden, let its spices flow. Let my beloved come to his garden, and eat its choicest fruits.</verse>
