    <verse value="1">Then the whole company of them arose and brought him before Pilate. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> And they began to accuse him, saying, "We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king." </verse>
    <verse value="3"> And Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And he answered him, "You have said so." </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, "I find no guilt in this man." </verse>
    <verse value="5"> But they were urgent, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee even to this place."</verse>
    <verse value="6"> When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> And when he learned that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard about him, and he was hoping to see some sign done by him. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> So he questioned him at some length, but he made no answer.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him. Then, arraying him in splendid clothing, he sent him back to Pilate. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before this they had been at enmity with each other.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, </verse>
    <verse value="14"> and said to them, "You brought me this man as one who was misleading the people. And after examining him before you, behold, I did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Look, nothing deserving death has been done by him. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> I will therefore punish and release him."</verse>
    <verse value="17">
    </verse>
    <verse value="18"> But they all cried out together, "Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas"-- </verse>
    <verse value="19"> a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city and for murder. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> Pilate addressed them once more, desiring to release Jesus,</verse>
    <verse value="21"> but they kept shouting, "Crucify, crucify him!"</verse>
    <verse value="22"> A third time he said to them, "Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no guilt deserving death. I will therefore punish and release him." </verse>
    <verse value="23"> But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified. And their voices prevailed.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> So Pilate decided that their demand should be granted.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus over to their will.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it behind Jesus. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> And there followed him a great multitude of the people and of women who were mourning and lamenting for him. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> But turning to them Jesus said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> For behold, the days are coming when they will say, 'Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!' </verse>
    <verse value="30"> Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us,' and to the hills, 'Cover us.' </verse>
    <verse value="31"> For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?"</verse>
    <verse value="32"> Two others, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him. </verse>
    <verse value="33"> And when they came to the place that is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> And Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." And they cast lots to divide his garments. </verse>
    <verse value="35"> And the people stood by, watching, but the rulers scoffed at him, saying, "He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, his Chosen One!" </verse>
    <verse value="36"> The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine </verse>
    <verse value="37"> and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!" </verse>
    <verse value="38"> There was also an inscription over him, "This is the King of the Jews."</verse>
    <verse value="39"> One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying, "Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!" </verse>
    <verse value="40"> But the other rebuked him, saying, "Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?</verse>
    <verse value="41"> And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong."</verse>
    <verse value="42"> And he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom." </verse>
    <verse value="43"> And he said to him, "Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise."</verse>
    <verse value="44"> It was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour, </verse>
    <verse value="45"> while the sun's light failed. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two. </verse>
    <verse value="46"> Then Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!" And having said this he breathed his last. </verse>
    <verse value="47"> Now when the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God, saying, "Certainly this man was innocent!" </verse>
    <verse value="48"> And all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle, when they saw what had taken place, returned home beating their breasts. </verse>
    <verse value="49"> And all his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee stood at a distance watching these things.</verse>
    <verse value="50"> Now there was a man named Joseph, from the Jewish town of Arimathea. He was a member of the council, a good and righteous man, </verse>
    <verse value="51"> who had not consented to their decision and action; and he was looking for the kingdom of God. </verse>
    <verse value="52"> This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
    <verse value="53"> Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud and laid him in a tomb cut in stone, where no one had ever yet been laid.</verse>
    <verse value="54"> It was the day of Preparation, and the Sabbath was beginning. </verse>
    <verse value="55"> The women who had come with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was laid. </verse>
    <verse value="56"> Then they returned and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</verse>
