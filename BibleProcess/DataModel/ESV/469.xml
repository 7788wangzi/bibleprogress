    <verse value="1">"But now, hear my speech, O Job, and listen to all my words.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Behold, I open my mouth; the tongue in my mouth speaks.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> My words declare the uprightness of my heart, and what my lips know they speak sincerely.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Answer me, if you can; set your words in order before me; take your stand.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Behold, I am toward God as you are; I too was pinched off from a piece of clay.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Behold, no fear of me need terrify you; my pressure will not be heavy upon you.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> "Surely you have spoken in my ears, and I have heard the sound of your words.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> You say, 'I am pure, without transgression; I am clean, and there is no iniquity in me.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Behold, he finds occasions against me, he counts me as his enemy,</verse>
    <verse value="11"> he puts my feet in the stocks and watches all my paths.'</verse>
    <verse value="12"> "Behold, in this you are not right. I will answer you, for God is greater than man.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Why do you contend against him, saying, 'He will answer none of man's words'?</verse>
    <verse value="14"> For God speaks in one way, and in two, though man does not perceive it.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, while they slumber on their beds,</verse>
    <verse value="16"> then he opens the ears of men and terrifies them with warnings,</verse>
    <verse value="17"> that he may turn man aside from his deed and conceal pride from a man;</verse>
    <verse value="18"> he keeps back his soul from the pit, his life from perishing by the sword.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> "Man is also rebuked with pain on his bed and with continual strife in his bones,</verse>
    <verse value="20"> so that his life loathes bread, and his appetite the choicest food.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen, and his bones that were not seen stick out.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> His soul draws near the pit, and his life to those who bring death.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> If there be for him an angel, a mediator, one of the thousand, to declare to man what is right for him,</verse>
    <verse value="24"> and he is merciful to him, and says, 'Deliver him from going down into the pit; I have found a ransom;</verse>
    <verse value="25"> let his flesh become fresh with youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor';</verse>
    <verse value="26"> then man prays to God, and he accepts him; he sees his face with a shout of joy, and he restores to man his righteousness.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> He sings before men and says: 'I sinned and perverted what was right, and it was not repaid to me.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> He has redeemed my soul from going down into the pit, and my life shall look upon the light.'</verse>
    <verse value="29"> "Behold, God does all these things, twice, three times, with a man,</verse>
    <verse value="30"> to bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be lighted with the light of life.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> Pay attention, O Job, listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> If you have any words, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify you.</verse>
    <verse value="33"> If not, listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom."</verse>
