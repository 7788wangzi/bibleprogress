    <verse value="1">Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who practice such things.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Do you suppose, O man--you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself--that you will escape the judgment of God?</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? </verse>
    <verse value="5"> But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> He will render to each one according to his works: </verse>
    <verse value="7"> to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; </verse>
    <verse value="8"> but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, </verse>
    <verse value="10"> but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> For God shows no partiality.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them </verse>
    <verse value="16"> on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God </verse>
    <verse value="18"> and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law;</verse>
    <verse value="19"> and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, </verse>
    <verse value="20"> an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth-- </verse>
    <verse value="21"> you then who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal? </verse>
    <verse value="22"> You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? </verse>
    <verse value="23"> You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> For, as it is written, "The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you."</verse>
    <verse value="25"> For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical. </verse>
    <verse value="29"> But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God.</verse>
