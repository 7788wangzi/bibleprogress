    <verse value="1">My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments with you,</verse>
    <verse value="2"> making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding;</verse>
    <verse value="3"> yes, if you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding,</verse>
    <verse value="4"> if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures,</verse>
    <verse value="5"> then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> For the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;</verse>
    <verse value="7"> he stores up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to those who walk in integrity,</verse>
    <verse value="8"> guarding the paths of justice and watching over the way of his saints.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity, every good path;</verse>
    <verse value="10"> for wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;</verse>
    <verse value="11"> discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you,</verse>
    <verse value="12"> delivering you from the way of evil, from men of perverted speech,</verse>
    <verse value="13"> who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,</verse>
    <verse value="14"> who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil,</verse>
    <verse value="15"> men whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> So you will be delivered from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words,</verse>
    <verse value="17"> who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God;</verse>
    <verse value="18"> for her house sinks down to death, and her paths to the departed;</verse>
    <verse value="19"> none who go to her come back, nor do they regain the paths of life.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> So you will walk in the way of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> For the upright will inhabit the land, and those with integrity will remain in it,</verse>
    <verse value="22"> but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be rooted out of it.</verse>
