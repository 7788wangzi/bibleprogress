    <verse value="1">Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things that have been accomplished among us, </verse>
    <verse value="2"> just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word have delivered them to us, </verse>
    <verse value="3"> it seemed good to me also, having followed all things closely for some time past, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, </verse>
    <verse value="4"> that you may have certainty concerning the things you have been taught.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abijah. And he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> And they were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty, </verse>
    <verse value="9"> according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth, </verse>
    <verse value="15"> for he will be great before the Lord. And he must not drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God,</verse>
    <verse value="17"> and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared."</verse>
    <verse value="18"> And Zechariah said to the angel, "How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years." </verse>
    <verse value="19"> And the angel answered him, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time." </verse>
    <verse value="21"> And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in the temple. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> And when he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he kept making signs to them and remained mute. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> And when his time of service was ended, he went to his home.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she kept herself hidden, saying,</verse>
    <verse value="25"> "Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among people."</verse>
    <verse value="26"> In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, </verse>
    <verse value="27"> to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> And he came to her and said, "Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!" </verse>
    <verse value="29"> But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> And the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. </verse>
    <verse value="31"> And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. </verse>
    <verse value="32"> He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, </verse>
    <verse value="33"> and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end."</verse>
    <verse value="34"> And Mary said to the angel, "How will this be, since I am a virgin?"</verse>
    <verse value="35"> And the angel answered her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy--the Son of God. </verse>
    <verse value="36"> And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. </verse>
    <verse value="37"> For nothing will be impossible with God." </verse>
    <verse value="38"> And Mary said, "Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word." And the angel departed from her.</verse>
    <verse value="39"> In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a town in Judah, </verse>
    <verse value="40"> and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
    <verse value="41"> And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, </verse>
    <verse value="42"> and she exclaimed with a loud cry, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! </verse>
    <verse value="43"> And why is this granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me? </verse>
    <verse value="44"> For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.</verse>
    <verse value="45"> And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord."</verse>
    <verse value="46"> And Mary said, "My soul magnifies the Lord,</verse>
    <verse value="47"> and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,</verse>
    <verse value="48"> for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant. For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed;</verse>
    <verse value="49"> for he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name.</verse>
    <verse value="50"> And his mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation.</verse>
    <verse value="51"> He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts;</verse>
    <verse value="52"> he has brought down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of humble estate;</verse>
    <verse value="53"> he has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away empty.</verse>
    <verse value="54"> He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy,</verse>
    <verse value="55"> as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his offspring forever."</verse>
    <verse value="56"> And Mary remained with her about three months and returned to her home.</verse>
    <verse value="57"> Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son.</verse>
    <verse value="58"> And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her. </verse>
    <verse value="59"> And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child. And they would have called him Zechariah after his father,</verse>
    <verse value="60"> but his mother answered, "No; he shall be called John." </verse>
    <verse value="61"> And they said to her, "None of your relatives is called by this name."</verse>
    <verse value="62"> And they made signs to his father, inquiring what he wanted him to be called. </verse>
    <verse value="63"> And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, "His name is John." And they all wondered. </verse>
    <verse value="64"> And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God. </verse>
    <verse value="65"> And fear came on all their neighbors. And all these things were talked about through all the hill country of Judea,</verse>
    <verse value="66"> and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, "What then will this child be?" For the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
    <verse value="67"> And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,</verse>
    <verse value="68"> "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has visited and redeemed his people</verse>
    <verse value="69"> and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David,</verse>
    <verse value="70"> as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,</verse>
    <verse value="71"> that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us;</verse>
    <verse value="72"> to show the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant,</verse>
    <verse value="73"> the oath that he swore to our father Abraham, to grant us</verse>
    <verse value="74"> that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, might serve him without fear,</verse>
    <verse value="75"> in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.</verse>
    <verse value="76"> And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,</verse>
    <verse value="77"> to give knowledge of salvation to his people in the forgiveness of their sins,</verse>
    <verse value="78"> because of the tender mercy of our God, whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high</verse>
    <verse value="79"> to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace."</verse>
    <verse value="80"> And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.</verse>
