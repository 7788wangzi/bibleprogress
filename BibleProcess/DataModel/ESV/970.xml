    <verse value="1">And as he came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Look, Teacher, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!" </verse>
    <verse value="2"> And Jesus said to him, "Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down."</verse>
    <verse value="3"> And as he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, </verse>
    <verse value="4"> "Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished?" </verse>
    <verse value="5"> And Jesus began to say to them, "See that no one leads you astray. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he!' and they will lead many astray. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. This must take place, but the end is not yet. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. These are but the beginning of the birth pains.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> "But be on your guard. For they will deliver you over to councils, and you will be beaten in synagogues, and you will stand before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all nations. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> And when they bring you to trial and deliver you over, do not be anxious beforehand what you are to say, but say whatever is given you in that hour, for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> And brother will deliver brother over to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> And you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> "But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where he ought not to be (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Let the one who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter his house, to take anything out, </verse>
    <verse value="16"> and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! </verse>
    <verse value="18"> Pray that it may not happen in winter.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> For in those days there will be such tribulation as has not been from the beginning of the creation that God created until now, and never will be. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> And if the Lord had not cut short the days, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, whom he chose, he shortened the days.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> And then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform signs and wonders, to lead astray, if possible, the elect. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> But be on guard; I have told you all things beforehand.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> "But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, </verse>
    <verse value="25"> and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> And then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> "From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that he is near, at the very gates. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> "But concerning that day or that hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. </verse>
    <verse value="33"> Be on guard, keep awake. For you do not know when the time will come. </verse>
    <verse value="34"> It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his servants in charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to stay awake. </verse>
    <verse value="35"> Therefore stay awake--for you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning-- </verse>
    <verse value="36"> lest he come suddenly and find you asleep. </verse>
    <verse value="37"> And what I say to you I say to all: Stay awake."</verse>
