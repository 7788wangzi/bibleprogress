    <verse value="1">First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people,</verse>
    <verse value="2"> for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, </verse>
    <verse value="4"> who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, </verse>
    <verse value="6"> who gave himself as a ransom for all, which is the testimony given at the proper time. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> I desire then that in every place the men should pray, lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling; </verse>
    <verse value="9"> likewise also that women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel, with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire, </verse>
    <verse value="10"> but with what is proper for women who profess godliness--with good works. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> For Adam was formed first, then Eve; </verse>
    <verse value="14"> and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Yet she will be saved through childbearing--if they continue in faith and love and holiness, with self-control.</verse>
