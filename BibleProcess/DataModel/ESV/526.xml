    <verse value="1">[A Song. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah.] Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised in the city of our God! His holy mountain,</verse>
    <verse value="2"> beautiful in elevation, is the joy of all the earth, Mount Zion, in the far north, the city of the great King.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Within her citadels God has made himself known as a fortress.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> For behold, the kings assembled; they came on together.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> As soon as they saw it, they were astounded; they were in panic; they took to flight.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Trembling took hold of them there, anguish as of a woman in labor.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> By the east wind you shattered the ships of Tarshish.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God, which God will establish forever. Selah</verse>
    <verse value="9"> We have thought on your steadfast love, O God, in the midst of your temple.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> As your name, O God, so your praise reaches to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is filled with righteousness.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Let Mount Zion be glad! Let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments!</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Walk about Zion, go around her, number her towers,</verse>
    <verse value="13"> consider well her ramparts, go through her citadels, that you may tell the next generation</verse>
    <verse value="14"> that this is God, our God forever and ever. He will guide us forever.</verse>
