    <verse value="16"> Ten cubits shall be the length of a frame, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each frame.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> There shall be two tenons in each frame, for fitting together. So shall you do for all the frames of the tabernacle.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> You shall make the frames for the tabernacle: twenty frames for the south side;</verse>
    <verse value="19"> and forty bases of silver you shall make under the twenty frames, two bases under one frame for its two tenons, and two bases under the next frame for its two tenons;</verse>
    <verse value="20"> and for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side twenty frames,</verse>
    <verse value="21"> and their forty bases of silver, two bases under one frame, and two bases under the next frame.</verse>

    <verse value="23"> And you shall make two frames for corners of the tabernacle in the rear;</verse>
    <verse value="24"> they shall be separate beneath, but joined at the top, at the first ring. Thus shall it be with both of them; they shall form the two corners.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> And there shall be eight frames, with their bases of silver, sixteen bases; two bases under one frame, and two bases under another frame.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> "You shall make bars of acacia wood, five for the frames of the one side of the tabernacle,</verse>

    <verse value="28"> The middle bar, halfway up the frames, shall run from end to end.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> You shall overlay the frames with gold and shall make their rings of gold for holders for the bars, and you shall overlay the bars with gold. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> Then you shall erect the tabernacle according to the plan for it that you were shown on the mountain.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> "And you shall make a veil of blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen. It shall be made with cherubim skillfully worked into it.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> And you shall hang it on four pillars of acacia overlaid with gold, with hooks of gold, on four bases of silver.</verse>
    <verse value="33"> And you shall hang the veil from the clasps, and bring the ark of the testimony in there within the veil. And the veil shall separate for you the Holy Place from the Most Holy. </verse>
    <verse value="34"> You shall put the mercy seat on the ark of the testimony in the Most Holy Place. </verse>
