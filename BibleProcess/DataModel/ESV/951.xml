    <verse value="1">And again Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying, </verse>
    <verse value="2"> "The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son, </verse>
    <verse value="3"> and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Again he sent other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, See, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.' </verse>
    <verse value="5"> But they paid no attention and went off, one to his farm, another to his business, </verse>
    <verse value="6"> while the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.'</verse>
    <verse value="10"> And those servants went out into the roads and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> "But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding garment. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> And he said to him, 'Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?' And he was speechless. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> Then the king said to the attendants, 'Bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' </verse>
    <verse value="14"> For many are called, but few are chosen."</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Then the Pharisees went and plotted how to entangle him in his words. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are true and teach the way of God truthfully, and you do not care about anyone's opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?" </verse>
    <verse value="18"> But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, "Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? </verse>
    <verse value="19"> Show me the coin for the tax." And they brought him a denarius. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> And Jesus said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?"</verse>
    <verse value="21"> They said, "Caesar's." Then he said to them, "Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."</verse>
    <verse value="22"> When they heard it, they marveled. And they left him and went away.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> The same day Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked him a question, </verse>
    <verse value="24"> saying, "Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies having no children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up children for his brother.'</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Now there were seven brothers among us. The first married and died, and having no children left his wife to his brother.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> So too the second and third, down to the seventh.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> After them all, the woman died.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> In the resurrection, therefore, of the seven, whose wife will she be? For they all had her."</verse>
    <verse value="29"> But Jesus answered them, "You are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God. </verse>
    <verse value="30"> For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. </verse>
    <verse value="31"> And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God: </verse>
    <verse value="32"> 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not God of the dead, but of the living."</verse>
    <verse value="33"> And when the crowd heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. </verse>
    <verse value="35"> And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him. </verse>
    <verse value="36"> "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?"</verse>
    <verse value="37"> And he said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. </verse>
    <verse value="38"> This is the great and first commandment.</verse>
    <verse value="39"> And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. </verse>
    <verse value="40"> On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets."</verse>
    <verse value="41"> Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, </verse>
    <verse value="42"> saying, "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" They said to him, "The son of David." </verse>
    <verse value="43"> He said to them, "How is it then that David, in the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying,</verse>
    <verse value="44"> "'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet'?</verse>
    <verse value="45"> If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?" </verse>
    <verse value="46"> And no one was able to answer him a word, nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions.</verse>
