    <verse value="1">After this Jesus went about in Galilee. He would not go about in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill him.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Now the Jews' Feast of Booths was at hand. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> So his brothers said to him, "Leave here and go to Judea, that your disciples also may see the works you are doing. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> For no one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world." </verse>
    <verse value="5"> For not even his brothers believed in him. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> Jesus said to them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always here. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it that its works are evil. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> You go up to the feast. I am not going up to this feast, for my time has not yet fully come."</verse>
    <verse value="9"> After saying this, he remained in Galilee.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> But after his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly but in private. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> The Jews were looking for him at the feast, and saying, "Where is he?" </verse>
    <verse value="12"> And there was much muttering about him among the people. While some said, "He is a good man," others said, "No, he is leading the people astray." </verse>
    <verse value="13"> Yet for fear of the Jews no one spoke openly of him.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> About the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> The Jews therefore marveled, saying, "How is it that this man has learning, when he has never studied?"</verse>
    <verse value="16"> So Jesus answered them, "My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> The one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory; but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> Has not Moses given you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?" </verse>
    <verse value="20"> The crowd answered, "You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?" </verse>
    <verse value="21"> Jesus answered them, "I did one work, and you all marvel at it. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> If on the Sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man's whole body well? </verse>
    <verse value="24"> Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment."</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said, "Is not this the man whom they seek to kill? </verse>
    <verse value="26"> And here he is, speaking openly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ? </verse>
    <verse value="27"> But we know where this man comes from, and when the Christ appears, no one will know where he comes from." </verse>
    <verse value="28"> So Jesus proclaimed, as he taught in the temple, "You know me, and you know where I come from? But I have not come of my own accord. He who sent me is true, and him you do not know. </verse>
    <verse value="29"> I know him, for I come from him, and he sent me." </verse>
    <verse value="30"> So they were seeking to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come. </verse>
    <verse value="31"> Yet many of the people believed in him. They said, "When the Christ appears, will he do more signs than this man has done?"</verse>
    <verse value="32"> The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about him, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him. </verse>
    <verse value="33"> Jesus then said, "I will be with you a little longer, and then I am going to him who sent me. </verse>
    <verse value="34"> You will seek me and you will not find me. Where I am you cannot come." </verse>
    <verse value="35"> The Jews said to one another, "Where does this man intend to go that we will not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks? </verse>
    <verse value="36"> What does he mean by saying, 'You will seek me and you will not find me,' and, 'Where I am you cannot come'?"</verse>
    <verse value="37"> On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. </verse>
    <verse value="38"> Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, 'Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.'" </verse>
    <verse value="39"> Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive, for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</verse>
    <verse value="40"> When they heard these words, some of the people said, "This really is the Prophet." </verse>
    <verse value="41"> Others said, "This is the Christ." But some said, "Is the Christ to come from Galilee? </verse>
    <verse value="42"> Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the offspring of David, and comes from Bethlehem, the village where David was?" </verse>
    <verse value="43"> So there was a division among the people over him. </verse>
    <verse value="44"> Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him.</verse>
    <verse value="45"> The officers then came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, "Why did you not bring him?" </verse>
    <verse value="46"> The officers answered, "No one ever spoke like this man!" </verse>
    <verse value="47"> The Pharisees answered them, "Have you also been deceived? </verse>
    <verse value="48"> Have any of the authorities or the Pharisees believed in him? </verse>
    <verse value="49"> But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed."</verse>
    <verse value="50"> Nicodemus, who had gone to him before, and who was one of them, said to them, </verse>
    <verse value="51"> "Does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he does?" </verse>
    <verse value="52"> They replied, "Are you from Galilee too? Search and see that no prophet arises from Galilee."</verse>
    <verse value="53"> [[They went each to his own house,</verse>
