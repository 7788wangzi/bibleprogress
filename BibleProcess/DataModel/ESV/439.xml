    <verse value="1">After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> And Job said:</verse>
    <verse value="3"> "Let the day perish on which I was born, and the night that said, 'A man is conceived.'</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Let that day be darkness! May God above not seek it, nor light shine upon it.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Let gloom and deep darkness claim it. Let clouds dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> That night--let thick darkness seize it! Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Behold, let that night be barren; let no joyful cry enter it.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Let those curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up Leviathan.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Let the stars of its dawn be dark; let it hope for light, but have none, nor see the eyelids of the morning,</verse>
    <verse value="10"> because it did not shut the doors of my mother's womb, nor hide trouble from my eyes.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> "Why did I not die at birth, come out from the womb and expire?</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should nurse?</verse>
    <verse value="13"> For then I would have lain down and been quiet; I would have slept; then I would have been at rest,</verse>
    <verse value="14"> with kings and counselors of the earth who rebuilt ruins for themselves,</verse>
    <verse value="15"> or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Or why was I not as a hidden stillborn child, as infants who never see the light?</verse>
    <verse value="17"> There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> There the prisoners are at ease together; they hear not the voice of the taskmaster.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> The small and the great are there, and the slave is free from his master.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> "Why is light given to him who is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul,</verse>
    <verse value="21"> who long for death, but it comes not, and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,</verse>
    <verse value="22"> who rejoice exceedingly and are glad when they find the grave?</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?</verse>
    <verse value="24"> For my sighing comes instead of my bread, and my groanings are poured out like water.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> For the thing that I fear comes upon me, and what I dread befalls me.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest, but trouble comes."</verse>
