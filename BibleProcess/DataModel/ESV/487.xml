    <verse value="1">[ To the choirmaster: according to Muth-labben. A Psalm of David.] I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart; I will recount all of your wonderful deeds.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> I will be glad and exult in you; I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> When my enemies turn back, they stumble and perish before your presence.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> For you have maintained my just cause; you have sat on the throne, giving righteous judgment.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> You have rebuked the nations; you have made the wicked perish; you have blotted out their name forever and ever.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> The enemy came to an end in everlasting ruins; their cities you rooted out; the very memory of them has perished.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> But the LORD sits enthroned forever; he has established his throne for justice,</verse>
    <verse value="8"> and he judges the world with righteousness; he judges the peoples with uprightness.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> The LORD is a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> And those who know your name put their trust in you, for you, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek you.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Sing praises to the LORD, who sits enthroned in Zion! Tell among the peoples his deeds!</verse>
    <verse value="12"> For he who avenges blood is mindful of them; he does not forget the cry of the afflicted.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Be gracious to me, O LORD! See my affliction from those who hate me, O you who lift me up from the gates of death,</verse>
    <verse value="14"> that I may recount all your praises, that in the gates of the daughter of Zion I may rejoice in your salvation.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> The nations have sunk in the pit that they made; in the net that they hid, their own foot has been caught.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> The LORD has made himself known; he has executed judgment; the wicked are snared in the work of their own hands. Higgaion. Selah</verse>
    <verse value="17"> The wicked shall return to Sheol, all the nations that forget God.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> For the needy shall not always be forgotten, and the hope of the poor shall not perish forever.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Arise, O LORD! Let not man prevail; let the nations be judged before you!</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Put them in fear, O LORD! Let the nations know that they are but men! Selah</verse>
