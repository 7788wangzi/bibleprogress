    <verse value="1">[A Prayer of one afflicted, when he is faint and pours out his complaint before the LORD.] Hear my prayer, O LORD; let my cry come to you!</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Do not hide your face from me in the day of my distress! Incline your ear to me; answer me speedily in the day when I call!</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For my days pass away like smoke, and my bones burn like a furnace.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> My heart is struck down like grass and has withered; I forget to eat my bread.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Because of my loud groaning my bones cling to my flesh.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> I am like a desert owl of the wilderness, like an owl of the waste places;</verse>
    <verse value="7"> I lie awake; I am like a lonely sparrow on the housetop.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> All the day my enemies taunt me; those who deride me use my name for a curse.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> For I eat ashes like bread and mingle tears with my drink,</verse>
    <verse value="10"> because of your indignation and anger; for you have taken me up and thrown me down.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> My days are like an evening shadow; I wither away like grass.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> But you, O LORD, are enthroned forever; you are remembered throughout all generations.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> You will arise and have pity on Zion; it is the time to favor her; the appointed time has come.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> For your servants hold her stones dear and have pity on her dust.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Nations will fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth will fear your glory.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> For the LORD builds up Zion; he appears in his glory;</verse>
    <verse value="17"> he regards the prayer of the destitute and does not despise their prayer.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Let this be recorded for a generation to come, so that a people yet to be created may praise the LORD:</verse>
    <verse value="19"> that he looked down from his holy height; from heaven the LORD looked at the earth,</verse>
    <verse value="20"> to hear the groans of the prisoners, to set free those who were doomed to die,</verse>
    <verse value="21"> that they may declare in Zion the name of the LORD, and in Jerusalem his praise,</verse>
    <verse value="22"> when peoples gather together, and kingdoms, to worship the LORD.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> He has broken my strength in midcourse; he has shortened my days.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> "O my God," I say, "take me not away in the midst of my days-- you whose years endure throughout all generations!"</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Of old you laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> They will perish, but you will remain; they will all wear out like a garment. You will change them like a robe, and they will pass away,</verse>
    <verse value="27"> but you are the same, and your years have no end.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> The children of your servants shall dwell secure; their offspring shall be established before you.</verse>
