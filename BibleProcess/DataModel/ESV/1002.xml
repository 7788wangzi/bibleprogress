    <verse value="1">After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, in Aramaic called Bethesda, which has five roofed colonnades. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> In these lay a multitude of invalids--blind, lame, and paralyzed. </verse>
    <verse value="4">
    </verse>
    <verse value="5"> One man was there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time, he said to him, "Do you want to be healed?"</verse>
    <verse value="7"> The sick man answered him, "Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, and while I am going another steps down before me."</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Jesus said to him, "Get up, take up your bed, and walk." </verse>
    <verse value="9"> And at once the man was healed, and he took up his bed and walked. Now that day was the Sabbath. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> So the Jews said to the man who had been healed, "It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your bed." </verse>
    <verse value="11"> But he answered them, "The man who healed me, that man said to me, 'Take up your bed, and walk.'"</verse>
    <verse value="12"> They asked him, "Who is the man who said to you, 'Take up your bed and walk'?"</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in the place. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, "See, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse may happen to you." </verse>
    <verse value="15"> The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> And this was why the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> But Jesus answered them, "My Father is working until now, and I am working."</verse>
    <verse value="18"> This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> So Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing. And greater works than these will he show him, so that you may marvel. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, </verse>
    <verse value="23"> that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> "Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself. </verse>
    <verse value="27"> And he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man. </verse>
    <verse value="28"> Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice </verse>
    <verse value="29"> and come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> "I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me. </verse>
    <verse value="31"> If I alone bear witness about myself, my testimony is not deemed true.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> There is another who bears witness about me, and I know that the testimony that he bears about me is true. </verse>
    <verse value="33"> You sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth. </verse>
    <verse value="34"> Not that the testimony that I receive is from man, but I say these things so that you may be saved. </verse>
    <verse value="35"> He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light. </verse>
    <verse value="36"> But the testimony that I have is greater than that of John. For the works that the Father has given me to accomplish, the very works that I am doing, bear witness about me that the Father has sent me. </verse>
    <verse value="37"> And the Father who sent me has himself borne witness about me. His voice you have never heard, his form you have never seen, </verse>
    <verse value="38"> and you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe the one whom he has sent. </verse>
    <verse value="39"> You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me, </verse>
    <verse value="40"> yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life. </verse>
    <verse value="41"> I do not receive glory from people. </verse>
    <verse value="42"> But I know that you do not have the love of God within you. </verse>
    <verse value="43"> I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him. </verse>
    <verse value="44"> How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? </verse>
    <verse value="45"> Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you: Moses, on whom you have set your hope.</verse>
    <verse value="46"> For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me. </verse>
    <verse value="47"> But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?"</verse>
