    <verse value="1">Oh give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever!</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he has redeemed from trouble</verse>
    <verse value="3"> and gathered in from the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Some wandered in desert wastes, finding no way to a city to dwell in;</verse>
    <verse value="5"> hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted within them.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> He led them by a straight way till they reached a city to dwell in.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of man!</verse>
    <verse value="9"> For he satisfies the longing soul, and the hungry soul he fills with good things.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, prisoners in affliction and in irons,</verse>
    <verse value="11"> for they had rebelled against the words of God, and spurned the counsel of the Most High.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> So he bowed their hearts down with hard labor; they fell down, with none to help.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and burst their bonds apart.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of man!</verse>
    <verse value="16"> For he shatters the doors of bronze and cuts in two the bars of iron.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Some were fools through their sinful ways, and because of their iniquities suffered affliction;</verse>
    <verse value="18"> they loathed any kind of food, and they drew near to the gates of death.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> He sent out his word and healed them, and delivered them from their destruction.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of man!</verse>
    <verse value="22"> And let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving, and tell of his deeds in songs of joy!</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Some went down to the sea in ships, doing business on the great waters;</verse>
    <verse value="24"> they saw the deeds of the LORD, his wondrous works in the deep.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> For he commanded and raised the stormy wind, which lifted up the waves of the sea.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> They mounted up to heaven; they went down to the depths; their courage melted away in their evil plight;</verse>
    <verse value="27"> they reeled and staggered like drunken men and were at their wits' end.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> He made the storm be still, and the waves of the sea were hushed.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Then they were glad that the waters were quiet, and he brought them to their desired haven.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of man!</verse>
    <verse value="32"> Let them extol him in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</verse>
    <verse value="33"> He turns rivers into a desert, springs of water into thirsty ground,</verse>
    <verse value="34"> a fruitful land into a salty waste, because of the evil of its inhabitants.</verse>
    <verse value="35"> He turns a desert into pools of water, a parched land into springs of water.</verse>
    <verse value="36"> And there he lets the hungry dwell, and they establish a city to live in;</verse>
    <verse value="37"> they sow fields and plant vineyards and get a fruitful yield.</verse>
    <verse value="38"> By his blessing they multiply greatly, and he does not let their livestock diminish.</verse>
    <verse value="39"> When they are diminished and brought low through oppression, evil, and sorrow,</verse>
    <verse value="40"> he pours contempt on princes and makes them wander in trackless wastes;</verse>
    <verse value="41"> but he raises up the needy out of affliction and makes their families like flocks.</verse>
    <verse value="42"> The upright see it and are glad, and all wickedness shuts its mouth.</verse>
    <verse value="43"> Whoever is wise, let him attend to these things; let them consider the steadfast love of the LORD.</verse>
