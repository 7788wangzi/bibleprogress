    <verse value="1">[To the choirmaster. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah.] Hear this, all peoples! Give ear, all inhabitants of the world,</verse>
    <verse value="2"> both low and high, rich and poor together!</verse>
    <verse value="3"> My mouth shall speak wisdom; the meditation of my heart shall be understanding.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> I will incline my ear to a proverb; I will solve my riddle to the music of the lyre.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Why should I fear in times of trouble, when the iniquity of those who cheat me surrounds me,</verse>
    <verse value="6"> those who trust in their wealth and boast of the abundance of their riches?</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Truly no man can ransom another, or give to God the price of his life,</verse>
    <verse value="8"> for the ransom of their life is costly and can never suffice,</verse>
    <verse value="9"> that he should live on forever and never see the pit.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> For he sees that even the wise die; the fool and the stupid alike must perish and leave their wealth to others.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Their graves are their homes forever, their dwelling places to all generations, though they called lands by their own names.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Man in his pomp will not remain; he is like the beasts that perish.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> This is the path of those who have foolish confidence; yet after them people approve of their boasts. Selah</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol; death shall be their shepherd, and the upright shall rule over them in the morning. Their form shall be consumed in Sheol, with no place to dwell.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> But God will ransom my soul from the power of Sheol, for he will receive me. Selah</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Be not afraid when a man becomes rich, when the glory of his house increases.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> For when he dies he will carry nothing away; his glory will not go down after him.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> For though, while he lives, he counts himself blessed--and though you get praise when you do well for yourself--</verse>
    <verse value="19"> his soul will go to the generation of his fathers, who will never again see light.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Man in his pomp yet without understanding is like the beasts that perish.</verse>
