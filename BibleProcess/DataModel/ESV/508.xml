    <verse value="1">[A Psalm of David. A song at the dedication of the temple.] I will extol you, O LORD, for you have drawn me up and have not let my foes rejoice over me.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> O LORD my God, I cried to you for help, and you have healed me.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> O LORD, you have brought up my soul from Sheol; you restored me to life from among those who go down to the pit.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Sing praises to the LORD, O you his saints, and give thanks to his holy name.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> For his anger is but for a moment, and his favor is for a lifetime. Weeping may tarry for the night, but joy comes with the morning.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> As for me, I said in my prosperity, "I shall never be moved."</verse>
    <verse value="7"> By your favor, O LORD, you made my mountain stand strong; you hid your face; I was dismayed.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> To you, O LORD, I cry, and to the Lord I plead for mercy:</verse>
    <verse value="9"> "What profit is there in my death, if I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it tell of your faithfulness?</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Hear, O LORD, and be merciful to me! O LORD, be my helper!"</verse>
    <verse value="11"> You have turned for me my mourning into dancing; you have loosed my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness,</verse>
    <verse value="12"> that my glory may sing your praise and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks to you forever!</verse>
