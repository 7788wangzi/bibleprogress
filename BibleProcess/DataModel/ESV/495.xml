    <verse value="1">[A Prayer of David.] Hear a just cause, O LORD; attend to my cry! Give ear to my prayer from lips free of deceit!</verse>
    <verse value="2"> From your presence let my vindication come! Let your eyes behold the right!</verse>
    <verse value="3"> You have tried my heart, you have visited me by night, you have tested me, and you will find nothing; I have purposed that my mouth will not transgress.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> With regard to the works of man, by the word of your lips I have avoided the ways of the violent.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> My steps have held fast to your paths; my feet have not slipped.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> I call upon you, for you will answer me, O God; incline your ear to me; hear my words.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Wondrously show your steadfast love, O Savior of those who seek refuge from their adversaries at your right hand.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings,</verse>
    <verse value="9"> from the wicked who do me violence, my deadly enemies who surround me.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> They close their hearts to pity; with their mouths they speak arrogantly.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> They have now surrounded our steps; they set their eyes to cast us to the ground.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> He is like a lion eager to tear, as a young lion lurking in ambush.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Arise, O LORD! Confront him, subdue him! Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword,</verse>
    <verse value="14"> from men by your hand, O LORD, from men of the world whose portion is in this life. You fill their womb with treasure; they are satisfied with children, and they leave their abundance to their infants.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> As for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness; when I awake, I shall be satisfied with your likeness.</verse>
