    <verse value="1">And Elihu continued, and said:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Bear with me a little, and I will show you, for I have yet something to say on God's behalf.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> I will get my knowledge from afar and ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> For truly my words are not false; one who is perfect in knowledge is with you.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> "Behold, God is mighty, and does not despise any; he is mighty in strength of understanding.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> He does not keep the wicked alive, but gives the afflicted their right.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> He does not withdraw his eyes from the righteous, but with kings on the throne he sets them forever, and they are exalted.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> And if they are bound in chains and caught in the cords of affliction,</verse>
    <verse value="9"> then he declares to them their work and their transgressions, that they are behaving arrogantly.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> He opens their ears to instruction and commands that they return from iniquity.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> If they listen and serve him, they complete their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasantness.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> But if they do not listen, they perish by the sword and die without knowledge.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> "The godless in heart cherish anger; they do not cry for help when he binds them.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> They die in youth, and their life ends among the cult prostitutes.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> He delivers the afflicted by their affliction and opens their ear by adversity.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> He also allured you out of distress into a broad place where there was no cramping, and what was set on your table was full of fatness.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> "But you are full of the judgment on the wicked; judgment and justice seize you.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Beware lest wrath entice you into scoffing, and let not the greatness of the ransom turn you aside.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Will your cry for help avail to keep you from distress, or all the force of your strength?</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Do not long for the night, when peoples vanish in their place.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Take care; do not turn to iniquity, for this you have chosen rather than affliction.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Behold, God is exalted in his power; who is a teacher like him?</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Who has prescribed for him his way, or who can say, 'You have done wrong'?</verse>
    <verse value="24"> "Remember to extol his work, of which men have sung.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> All mankind has looked on it; man beholds it from afar.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Behold, God is great, and we know him not; the number of his years is unsearchable.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> For he draws up the drops of water; they distill his mist in rain,</verse>
    <verse value="28"> which the skies pour down and drop on mankind abundantly.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds, the thunderings of his pavilion?</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Behold, he scatters his lightning about him and covers the roots of the sea.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> For by these he judges peoples; he gives food in abundance.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> He covers his hands with the lightning and commands it to strike the mark.</verse>
    <verse value="33"> Its crashing declares his presence; the cattle also declare that he rises.</verse>
