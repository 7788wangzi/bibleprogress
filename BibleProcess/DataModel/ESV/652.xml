    <verse value="1">Be not envious of evil men, nor desire to be with them,</verse>
    <verse value="2"> for their hearts devise violence, and their lips talk of trouble.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> By wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established;</verse>
    <verse value="4"> by knowledge the rooms are filled with all precious and pleasant riches.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> A wise man is full of strength, and a man of knowledge enhances his might,</verse>
    <verse value="6"> for by wise guidance you can wage your war, and in abundance of counselors there is victory.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Wisdom is too high for a fool; in the gate he does not open his mouth.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Whoever plans to do evil will be called a schemer.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> The devising of folly is sin, and the scoffer is an abomination to mankind.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> If you faint in the day of adversity, your strength is small.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Rescue those who are being taken away to death; hold back those who are stumbling to the slaughter.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> If you say, "Behold, we did not know this," does not he who weighs the heart perceive it? Does not he who keeps watch over your soul know it, and will he not repay man according to his work?</verse>
    <verse value="13"> My son, eat honey, for it is good, and the drippings of the honeycomb are sweet to your taste.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Know that wisdom is such to your soul; if you find it, there will be a future, and your hope will not be cut off.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Lie not in wait as a wicked man against the dwelling of the righteous; do no violence to his home;</verse>
    <verse value="16"> for the righteous falls seven times and rises again, but the wicked stumble in times of calamity.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles,</verse>
    <verse value="18"> lest the LORD see it and be displeased, and turn away his anger from him.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Fret not yourself because of evildoers, and be not envious of the wicked,</verse>
    <verse value="20"> for the evil man has no future; the lamp of the wicked will be put out.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> My son, fear the LORD and the king, and do not join with those who do otherwise,</verse>
    <verse value="22"> for disaster will arise suddenly from them, and who knows the ruin that will come from them both?</verse>
    <verse value="23"> These also are sayings of the wise. Partiality in judging is not good.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Whoever says to the wicked, "You are in the right," will be cursed by peoples, abhorred by nations,</verse>
    <verse value="25"> but those who rebuke the wicked will have delight, and a good blessing will come upon them.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Whoever gives an honest answer kisses the lips.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Prepare your work outside; get everything ready for yourself in the field, and after that build your house.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Be not a witness against your neighbor without cause, and do not deceive with your lips.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Do not say, "I will do to him as he has done to me; I will pay the man back for what he has done."</verse>
    <verse value="30"> I passed by the field of a sluggard, by the vineyard of a man lacking sense,</verse>
    <verse value="31"> and behold, it was all overgrown with thorns; the ground was covered with nettles, and its stone wall was broken down.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> Then I saw and considered it; I looked and received instruction.</verse>
    <verse value="33"> A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,</verse>
    <verse value="34"> and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man.</verse>
