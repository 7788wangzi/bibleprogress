    <verse value="1">The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> To know wisdom and instruction, to understand words of insight,</verse>
    <verse value="3"> to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness, justice, and equity;</verse>
    <verse value="4"> to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the youth--</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Let the wise hear and increase in learning, and the one who understands obtain guidance,</verse>
    <verse value="6"> to understand a proverb and a saying, the words of the wise and their riddles.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Hear, my son, your father's instruction, and forsake not your mother's teaching,</verse>
    <verse value="9"> for they are a graceful garland for your head and pendants for your neck.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> If they say, "Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us ambush the innocent without reason;</verse>
    <verse value="12"> like Sheol let us swallow them alive, and whole, like those who go down to the pit;</verse>
    <verse value="13"> we shall find all precious goods, we shall fill our houses with plunder;</verse>
    <verse value="14"> throw in your lot among us; we will all have one purse"--</verse>
    <verse value="15"> my son, do not walk in the way with them; hold back your foot from their paths,</verse>
    <verse value="16"> for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> For in vain is a net spread in the sight of any bird,</verse>
    <verse value="18"> but these men lie in wait for their own blood; they set an ambush for their own lives.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Such are the ways of everyone who is greedy for unjust gain; it takes away the life of its possessors.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Wisdom cries aloud in the street, in the markets she raises her voice;</verse>
    <verse value="21"> at the head of the noisy streets she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:</verse>
    <verse value="22"> "How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge?</verse>
    <verse value="23"> If you turn at my reproof, behold, I will pour out my spirit to you; I will make my words known to you.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Because I have called and you refused to listen, have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded,</verse>
    <verse value="25"> because you have ignored all my counsel and would have none of my reproof,</verse>
    <verse value="26"> I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when terror strikes you,</verse>
    <verse value="27"> when terror strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently but will not find me.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD,</verse>
    <verse value="30"> would have none of my counsel and despised all my reproof,</verse>
    <verse value="31"> therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way, and have their fill of their own devices.</verse>
    <verse value="32"> For the simple are killed by their turning away, and the complacency of fools destroys them;</verse>
    <verse value="33"> but whoever listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease, without dread of disaster."</verse>
