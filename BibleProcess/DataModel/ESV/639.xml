    <verse value="3"> The integrity of the upright guides them, but the crookedness of the treacherous destroys them.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> The righteousness of the blameless keeps his way straight, but the wicked falls by his own wickedness.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> The righteousness of the upright delivers them, but the treacherous are taken captive by their lust.</verse>

    <verse value="8"> The righteous is delivered from trouble, and the wicked walks into it instead.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> With his mouth the godless man would destroy his neighbor, but by knowledge the righteous are delivered.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices, and when the wicked perish there are shouts of gladness.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> By the blessing of the upright a city is exalted, but by the mouth of the wicked it is overthrown.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Whoever belittles his neighbor lacks sense, but a man of understanding remains silent.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Whoever goes about slandering reveals secrets, but he who is trustworthy in spirit keeps a thing covered.</verse>

    <verse value="21"> Be assured, an evil person will not go unpunished, but the offspring of the righteous will be delivered.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Like a gold ring in a pig's snout is a beautiful woman without discretion.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> The desire of the righteous ends only in good; the expectation of the wicked in wrath.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> One gives freely, yet grows all the richer; another withholds what he should give, and only suffers want.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Whoever brings blessing will be enriched, and one who waters will himself be watered.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> The people curse him who holds back grain, but a blessing is on the head of him who sells it.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> Whoever diligently seeks good seeks favor, but evil comes to him who searches for it.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Whoever trusts in his riches will fall, but the righteous will flourish like a green leaf.</verse>
