    <verse value="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Can a man be profitable to God? Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are in the right, or is it gain to him if you make your ways blameless?</verse>
    <verse value="4"> Is it for your fear of him that he reproves you and enters into judgment with you?</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Is not your evil abundant? There is no end to your iniquities.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> For you have exacted pledges of your brothers for nothing and stripped the naked of their clothing.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> You have given no water to the weary to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> The man with power possessed the land, and the favored man lived in it.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> You have sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless were crushed.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Therefore snares are all around you, and sudden terror overwhelms you,</verse>
    <verse value="11"> or darkness, so that you cannot see, and a flood of water covers you.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> "Is not God high in the heavens? See the highest stars, how lofty they are!</verse>
    <verse value="13"> But you say, 'What does God know? Can he judge through the deep darkness?</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Thick clouds veil him, so that he does not see, and he walks on the vault of heaven.'</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Will you keep to the old way that wicked men have trod?</verse>
    <verse value="16"> They were snatched away before their time; their foundation was washed away.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> They said to God, 'Depart from us,' and 'What can the Almighty do to us?'</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Yet he filled their houses with good things-- but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> The righteous see it and are glad; the innocent one mocks at them,</verse>
    <verse value="20"> saying, 'Surely our adversaries are cut off, and what they left the fire has consumed.'</verse>
    <verse value="21"> "Agree with God, and be at peace; thereby good will come to you.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Receive instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words in your heart.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> If you return to the Almighty you will be built up; if you remove injustice far from your tents,</verse>
    <verse value="24"> if you lay gold in the dust, and gold of Ophir among the stones of the torrent-bed,</verse>
    <verse value="25"> then the Almighty will be your gold and your precious silver.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty and lift up your face to God.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> You will make your prayer to him, and he will hear you, and you will pay your vows.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> You will decide on a matter, and it will be established for you, and light will shine on your ways.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> For when they are humbled you say, 'It is because of pride'; but he saves the lowly.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> He delivers even the one who is not innocent, who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands."</verse>
