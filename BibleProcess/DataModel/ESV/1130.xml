    <verse value="2"> in hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before the ages began </verse>
    <verse value="3"> and at the proper time manifested in his word through the preaching with which I have been entrusted by the command of God our Savior;</verse>
    <verse value="4"> To Titus, my true child in a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> This is why I left you in Crete, so that you might put what remained into order, and appoint elders in every town as I directed you--</verse>
    <verse value="6"> if anyone is above reproach, the husband of one wife, and his children are believers and not open to the charge of debauchery or insubordination. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> For an overseer, as God's steward, must be above reproach. He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain, </verse>
    <verse value="8"> but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it.</verse>

    <verse value="11"> They must be silenced, since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for shameful gain what they ought not to teach. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> One of the Cretans, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons." </verse>
    <verse value="13"> This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, </verse>
    <verse value="14"> not devoting themselves to Jewish myths and the commands of people who turn away from the truth. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> To the pure, all things are pure, but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their minds and their consciences are defiled. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> They profess to know God, but they deny him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, unfit for any good work.</verse>
