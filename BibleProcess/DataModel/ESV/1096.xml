    <verse value="1">For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Look: I, Paul, say to you that if you accept circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that he is obligated to keep the whole law. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> For through the Spirit, by faith, we ourselves eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth? </verse>
    <verse value="8"> This persuasion is not from him who calls you. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> A little leaven leavens the whole lump. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> I have confidence in the Lord that you will take no other view than mine, and the one who is troubling you will bear the penalty, whoever he is. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> But if I, brothers, still preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been removed. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> I wish those who unsettle you would emasculate themselves!</verse>
    <verse value="13"> For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." </verse>
    <verse value="15"> But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. </verse>
    <verse value="17"> For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, </verse>
    <verse value="20"> idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, </verse>
    <verse value="21"> envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, </verse>
    <verse value="23"> gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. </verse>
    <verse value="26"> Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.</verse>
