    <verse value="1">Oh that you were like a brother to me who nursed at my mother's breasts! If I found you outside, I would kiss you, and none would despise me.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> I would lead you and bring you into the house of my mother-- she who used to teach me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, the juice of my pomegranate.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me!</verse>
    <verse value="4"> I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that you not stir up or awaken love until it pleases.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Who is that coming up from the wilderness, leaning on her beloved? Under the apple tree I awakened you. There your mother was in labor with you; there she who bore you was in labor.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm, for love is strong as death, jealousy is fierce as the grave. Its flashes are flashes of fire, the very flame of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. If a man offered for love all the wealth of his house, he would be utterly despised.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> We have a little sister, and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister on the day when she is spoken for?</verse>
    <verse value="9"> If she is a wall, we will build on her a battlement of silver, but if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> I was a wall, and my breasts were like towers; then I was in his eyes as one who finds peace.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard to keepers; each one was to bring for its fruit a thousand pieces of silver.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> My vineyard, my very own, is before me; you, O Solomon, may have the thousand, and the keepers of the fruit two hundred.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> O you who dwell in the gardens, with companions listening for your voice; let me hear it.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Make haste, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices.</verse>
