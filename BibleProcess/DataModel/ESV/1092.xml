    <verse value="1">Paul, an apostle--not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead-- </verse>
    <verse value="2"> and all the brothers who are with me, To the churches of Galatia:</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, </verse>
    <verse value="4"> who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, </verse>
    <verse value="5"> to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel-- </verse>
    <verse value="7"> not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> For I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel that was preached by me is not man's gospel. </verse>
    <verse value="12"> For I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ. </verse>
    <verse value="13"> For you have heard of my former life in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and who called me by his grace, </verse>
    <verse value="16"> was pleased to reveal his Son to me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone; </verse>
    <verse value="17"> nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and remained with him fifteen days. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord's brother. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> (In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie!) </verse>
    <verse value="21"> Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> And I was still unknown in person to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> They only were hearing it said, "He who used to persecute us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy."</verse>
    <verse value="24"> And they glorified God because of me.</verse>
