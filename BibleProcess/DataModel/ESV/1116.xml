    <verse value="1">Now concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need to have anything written to you. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> For you yourselves are fully aware that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> While people are saying, "There is peace and security," then sudden destruction will come upon them as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> But you are not in darkness, brothers, for that day to surprise you like a thief. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> For you are all children of light, children of the day. We are not of the night or of the darkness. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> So then let us not sleep, as others do, but let us keep awake and be sober. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, are drunk at night. </verse>
    <verse value="8"> But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, </verse>
    <verse value="10"> who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we might live with him. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> We ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you, </verse>
    <verse value="13"> and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves. </verse>
    <verse value="14"> And we urge you, brothers, admonish the idle, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with them all. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> See that no one repays anyone evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to everyone. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> Rejoice always, </verse>
    <verse value="17"> pray without ceasing, </verse>
    <verse value="18"> give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> Do not quench the Spirit. </verse>
    <verse value="20"> Do not despise prophecies, </verse>
    <verse value="21"> but test everything; hold fast what is good. </verse>
    <verse value="22"> Abstain from every form of evil.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> Brothers, pray for us.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> I put you under oath before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</verse>
