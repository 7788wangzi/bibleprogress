    <verse value="1">So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> Then Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, burned with anger. He burned with anger at Job because he justified himself rather than God.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> He burned with anger also at Job's three friends because they had found no answer, although they had declared Job to be in the wrong. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were older than he.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, he burned with anger.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said: "I am young in years, and you are aged; therefore I was timid and afraid to declare my opinion to you.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> I said, 'Let days speak, and many years teach wisdom.'</verse>
    <verse value="8"> But it is the spirit in man, the breath of the Almighty, that makes him understand.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> It is not the old who are wise, nor the aged who understand what is right.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Therefore I say, 'Listen to me; let me also declare my opinion.'</verse>
    <verse value="11"> "Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your wise sayings, while you searched out what to say.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> I gave you my attention, and, behold, there was none among you who refuted Job or who answered his words.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Beware lest you say, 'We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not a man.'</verse>
    <verse value="14"> He has not directed his words against me, and I will not answer him with your speeches.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> "They are dismayed; they answer no more; they have not a word to say.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> And shall I wait, because they do not speak, because they stand there, and answer no more?</verse>
    <verse value="17"> I also will answer with my share; I also will declare my opinion.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> For I am full of words; the spirit within me constrains me.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Behold, my belly is like wine that has no vent; like new wineskins ready to burst.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> I must speak, that I may find relief; I must open my lips and answer.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> I will not show partiality to any man or use flattery toward any person.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> For I do not know how to flatter, else my Maker would soon take me away.</verse>
