    <verse value="1">Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "How long will you say these things, and the words of your mouth be a great wind?</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert the right?</verse>
    <verse value="4"> If your children have sinned against him, he has delivered them into the hand of their transgression.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> If you will seek God and plead with the Almighty for mercy,</verse>
    <verse value="6"> if you are pure and upright, surely then he will rouse himself for you and restore your rightful habitation.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> And though your beginning was small, your latter days will be very great.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> "For inquire, please, of bygone ages, and consider what the fathers have searched out.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> For we are but of yesterday and know nothing, for our days on earth are a shadow.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Will they not teach you and tell you and utter words out of their understanding?</verse>
    <verse value="11"> "Can papyrus grow where there is no marsh? Can reeds flourish where there is no water?</verse>
    <verse value="12"> While yet in flower and not cut down, they wither before any other plant.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Such are the paths of all who forget God; the hope of the godless shall perish.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> His confidence is severed, and his trust is a spider's web.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> He leans against his house, but it does not stand; he lays hold of it, but it does not endure.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> He is a lush plant before the sun, and his shoots spread over his garden.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> His roots entwine the stone heap; he looks upon a house of stones.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> If he is destroyed from his place, then it will deny him, saying, 'I have never seen you.'</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the soil others will spring.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> "Behold, God will not reject a blameless man, nor take the hand of evildoers.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with shouting.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, and the tent of the wicked will be no more."</verse>
