    <verse value="1">O LORD, God of vengeance, O God of vengeance, shine forth!</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Rise up, O judge of the earth; repay to the proud what they deserve!</verse>
    <verse value="3"> O LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked exult?</verse>
    <verse value="4"> They pour out their arrogant words; all the evildoers boast.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> They crush your people, O LORD, and afflict your heritage.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> They kill the widow and the sojourner, and murder the fatherless;</verse>
    <verse value="7"> and they say, "The LORD does not see; the God of Jacob does not perceive."</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Understand, O dullest of the people! Fools, when will you be wise?</verse>
    <verse value="9"> He who planted the ear, does he not hear? He who formed the eye, does he not see?</verse>
    <verse value="10"> He who disciplines the nations, does he not rebuke? He who teaches man knowledge--</verse>
    <verse value="11"> the LORD--knows the thoughts of man, that they are but a breath.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Blessed is the man whom you discipline, O LORD, and whom you teach out of your law,</verse>
    <verse value="13"> to give him rest from days of trouble, until a pit is dug for the wicked.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> For the LORD will not forsake his people; he will not abandon his heritage;</verse>
    <verse value="15"> for justice will return to the righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Who rises up for me against the wicked? Who stands up for me against evildoers?</verse>
    <verse value="17"> If the LORD had not been my help, my soul would soon have lived in the land of silence.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> When I thought, "My foot slips," your steadfast love, O LORD, held me up.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> When the cares of my heart are many, your consolations cheer my soul.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Can wicked rulers be allied with you, those who frame injustice by statute?</verse>
    <verse value="21"> They band together against the life of the righteous and condemn the innocent to death.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> But the LORD has become my stronghold, and my God the rock of my refuge.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> He will bring back on them their iniquity and wipe them out for their wickedness; the LORD our God will wipe them out.</verse>
