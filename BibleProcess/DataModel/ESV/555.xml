    <verse value="1">[To the choirmaster: according to Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph.] I cry aloud to God, aloud to God, and he will hear me.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord; in the night my hand is stretched out without wearying; my soul refuses to be comforted.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> When I remember God, I moan; when I meditate, my spirit faints. Selah</verse>
    <verse value="4"> You hold my eyelids open; I am so troubled that I cannot speak.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> I consider the days of old, the years long ago.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> I said, "Let me remember my song in the night; let me meditate in my heart." Then my spirit made a diligent search:</verse>
    <verse value="7"> "Will the Lord spurn forever, and never again be favorable?</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Has his steadfast love forever ceased? Are his promises at an end for all time?</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he in anger shut up his compassion?" Selah</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Then I said, "I will appeal to this, to the years of the right hand of the Most High."</verse>
    <verse value="11"> I will remember the deeds of the LORD; yes, I will remember your wonders of old.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> I will ponder all your work, and meditate on your mighty deeds.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Your way, O God, is holy. What god is great like our God?</verse>
    <verse value="14"> You are the God who works wonders; you have made known your might among the peoples.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> You with your arm redeemed your people, the children of Jacob and Joseph. Selah</verse>
    <verse value="16"> When the waters saw you, O God, when the waters saw you, they were afraid; indeed, the deep trembled.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> The clouds poured out water; the skies gave forth thunder; your arrows flashed on every side.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> The crash of your thunder was in the whirlwind; your lightnings lighted up the world; the earth trembled and shook.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Your way was through the sea, your path through the great waters; yet your footprints were unseen.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</verse>
