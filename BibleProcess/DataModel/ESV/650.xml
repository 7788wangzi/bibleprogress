    <verse value="1">A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches, and favor is better than silver or gold.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> The rich and the poor meet together; the LORD is the maker of them all.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> The prudent sees danger and hides himself, but the simple go on and suffer for it.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> The reward for humility and fear of the LORD is riches and honor and life.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Thorns and snares are in the way of the crooked; whoever guards his soul will keep far from them.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> The rich rules over the poor, and the borrower is the slave of the lender.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Whoever sows injustice will reap calamity, and the rod of his fury will fail.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Whoever has a bountiful eye will be blessed, for he shares his bread with the poor.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Drive out a scoffer, and strife will go out, and quarreling and abuse will cease.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> He who loves purity of heart, and whose speech is gracious, will have the king as his friend.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> The eyes of the LORD keep watch over knowledge, but he overthrows the words of the traitor.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> The sluggard says, "There is a lion outside! I shall be killed in the streets!"</verse>
    <verse value="14"> The mouth of forbidden women is a deep pit; he with whom the LORD is angry will fall into it.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline drives it far from him.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> Whoever oppresses the poor to increase his own wealth, or gives to the rich, will only come to poverty.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Incline your ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply your heart to my knowledge,</verse>
    <verse value="18"> for it will be pleasant if you keep them within you, if all of them are ready on your lips.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> That your trust may be in the LORD, I have made them known to you today, even to you.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Have I not written for you thirty sayings of counsel and knowledge,</verse>
    <verse value="21"> to make you know what is right and true, that you may give a true answer to those who sent you?</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Do not rob the poor, because he is poor, or crush the afflicted at the gate,</verse>
    <verse value="23"> for the LORD will plead their cause and rob of life those who rob them.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> Make no friendship with a man given to anger, nor go with a wrathful man,</verse>
    <verse value="25"> lest you learn his ways and entangle yourself in a snare.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Be not one of those who give pledges, who put up security for debts.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> If you have nothing with which to pay, why should your bed be taken from under you?</verse>
    <verse value="28"> Do not move the ancient landmark that your fathers have set.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Do you see a man skillful in his work? He will stand before kings; he will not stand before obscure men.</verse>
