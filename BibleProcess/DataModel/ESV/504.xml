    <verse value="1">[Of David.] Vindicate me, O LORD, for I have walked in my integrity, and I have trusted in the LORD without wavering.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Prove me, O LORD, and try me; test my heart and my mind.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For your steadfast love is before my eyes, and I walk in your faithfulness.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> I do not sit with men of falsehood, nor do I consort with hypocrites.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> I hate the assembly of evildoers, and I will not sit with the wicked.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> I wash my hands in innocence and go around your altar, O LORD,</verse>
    <verse value="7"> proclaiming thanksgiving aloud, and telling all your wondrous deeds.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> O LORD, I love the habitation of your house and the place where your glory dwells.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Do not sweep my soul away with sinners, nor my life with bloodthirsty men,</verse>
    <verse value="10"> in whose hands are evil devices, and whose right hands are full of bribes.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> But as for me, I shall walk in my integrity; redeem me, and be gracious to me.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> My foot stands on level ground; in the great assembly I will bless the LORD.</verse>
