    <verse value="1">Then Job answered and said:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Today also my complaint is bitter; my hand is heavy on account of my groaning.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Oh, that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his seat!</verse>
    <verse value="4"> I would lay my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> I would know what he would answer me and understand what he would say to me.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? No; he would pay attention to me.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> There an upright man could argue with him, and I would be acquitted forever by my judge.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> "Behold, I go forward, but he is not there, and backward, but I do not perceive him;</verse>
    <verse value="9"> on the left hand when he is working, I do not behold him; he turns to the right hand, but I do not see him.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> But he knows the way that I take; when he has tried me, I shall come out as gold.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> My foot has held fast to his steps; I have kept his way and have not turned aside.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> I have not departed from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my portion of food.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> But he is unchangeable, and who can turn him back? What he desires, that he does.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> For he will complete what he appoints for me, and many such things are in his mind.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Therefore I am terrified at his presence; when I consider, I am in dread of him.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me;</verse>
    <verse value="17"> yet I am not silenced because of the darkness, nor because thick darkness covers my face.</verse>
