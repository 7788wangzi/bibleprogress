    <verse value="1">You then, my child, be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus, </verse>
    <verse value="2"> and what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> No soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuits, since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him. </verse>
    <verse value="5"> An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. </verse>
    <verse value="6"> It is the hard-working farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, the offspring of David, as preached in my gospel, </verse>
    <verse value="9"> for which I am suffering, bound with chains as a criminal. But the word of God is not bound!</verse>
    <verse value="10"> Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> The saying is trustworthy, for: If we have died with him, we will also live with him;</verse>
    <verse value="12"> if we endure, we will also reign with him; if we deny him, he also will deny us;</verse>
    <verse value="13"> if we are faithless, he remains faithful-- for he cannot deny himself.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Remind them of these things, and charge them before God not to quarrel about words, which does no good, but only ruins the hearers. </verse>
    <verse value="15"> Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> But avoid irreverent babble, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness, </verse>
    <verse value="17"> and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, </verse>
    <verse value="18"> who have swerved from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened. They are upsetting the faith of some. </verse>
    <verse value="19"> But God's firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity."</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and clay, some for honorable use, some for dishonorable. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart. </verse>
    <verse value="23"> Have nothing to do with foolish, ignorant controversies; you know that they breed quarrels. </verse>
    <verse value="24"> And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil, </verse>
    <verse value="25"> correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth, </verse>
    <verse value="26"> and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will.</verse>
