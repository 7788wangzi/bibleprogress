    <verse value="5"> do not lift up your horn on high, or speak with haughty neck.'"</verse>
    <verse value="6"> For not from the east or from the west and not from the wilderness comes lifting up,</verse>
    <verse value="7"> but it is God who executes judgment, putting down one and lifting up another.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup with foaming wine, well mixed, and he pours out from it, and all the wicked of the earth shall drain it down to the dregs.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> But I will declare it forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> All the horns of the wicked I will cut off, but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.</verse>
