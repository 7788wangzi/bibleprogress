    <verse value="1">[To the choirmaster: according to The Sheminith. A Psalm of David.] Save, O LORD, for the godly one is gone; for the faithful have vanished from among the children of man.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> Everyone utters lies to his neighbor; with flattering lips and a double heart they speak.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> May the LORD cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that makes great boasts,</verse>
    <verse value="4"> those who say, "With our tongue we will prevail, our lips are with us; who is master over us?"</verse>
    <verse value="5"> "Because the poor are plundered, because the needy groan, I will now arise," says the LORD; "I will place him in the safety for which he longs."</verse>
    <verse value="6"> The words of the LORD are pure words, like silver refined in a furnace on the ground, purified seven times.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> You, O LORD, will keep them; you will guard us from this generation forever.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> On every side the wicked prowl, as vileness is exalted among the children of man.</verse>
