    <verse value="1">And Job again took up his discourse, and said:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Oh, that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me,</verse>
    <verse value="3"> when his lamp shone upon my head, and by his light I walked through darkness,</verse>
    <verse value="4"> as I was in my prime, when the friendship of God was upon my tent,</verse>
    <verse value="5"> when the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were all around me,</verse>
    <verse value="6"> when my steps were washed with butter, and the rock poured out for me streams of oil!</verse>
    <verse value="7"> When I went out to the gate of the city, when I prepared my seat in the square,</verse>
    <verse value="8"> the young men saw me and withdrew, and the aged rose and stood;</verse>
    <verse value="9"> the princes refrained from talking and laid their hand on their mouth;</verse>
    <verse value="10"> the voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> When the ear heard, it called me blessed, and when the eye saw, it approved,</verse>
    <verse value="12"> because I delivered the poor who cried for help, and the fatherless who had none to help him.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> The blessing of him who was about to perish came upon me, and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my justice was like a robe and a turban.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> I was a father to the needy, and I searched out the cause of him whom I did not know.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> I broke the fangs of the unrighteous and made him drop his prey from his teeth.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Then I thought, 'I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand,</verse>
    <verse value="19"> my roots spread out to the waters, with the dew all night on my branches,</verse>
    <verse value="20"> my glory fresh with me, and my bow ever new in my hand.'</verse>
    <verse value="21"> "Men listened to me and waited and kept silence for my counsel.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> After I spoke they did not speak again, and my word dropped upon them.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> They waited for me as for the rain, and they opened their mouths as for the spring rain.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> I smiled on them when they had no confidence, and the light of my face they did not cast down.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> I chose their way and sat as chief, and I lived like a king among his troops, like one who comforts mourners.</verse>
