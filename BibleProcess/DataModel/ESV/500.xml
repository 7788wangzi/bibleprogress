    <verse value="1">[To the choirmaster: according to The Doe of the Dawn. A Psalm of David.] My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, from the words of my groaning?</verse>
    <verse value="2"> O my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer, and by night, but I find no rest.</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Yet you are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> In you our fathers trusted; they trusted, and you delivered them.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> To you they cried and were rescued; in you they trusted and were not put to shame.</verse>
    <verse value="6"> But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by mankind and despised by the people.</verse>
    <verse value="7"> All who see me mock me; they make mouths at me; they wag their heads;</verse>
    <verse value="8"> "He trusts in the LORD; let him deliver him; let him rescue him, for he delights in him!"</verse>
    <verse value="9"> Yet you are he who took me from the womb; you made me trust you at my mother's breasts.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> On you was I cast from my birth, and from my mother's womb you have been my God.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> Be not far from me, for trouble is near, and there is none to help.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Many bulls encompass me; strong bulls of Bashan surround me;</verse>
    <verse value="13"> they open wide their mouths at me, like a ravening and roaring lion.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; my heart is like wax; it is melted within my breast;</verse>
    <verse value="15"> my strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to my jaws; you lay me in the dust of death.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> For dogs encompass me; a company of evildoers encircles me; they have pierced my hands and feet--</verse>
    <verse value="17"> I can count all my bones-- they stare and gloat over me;</verse>
    <verse value="18"> they divide my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> But you, O LORD, do not be far off! O you my help, come quickly to my aid!</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Deliver my soul from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dog!</verse>
    <verse value="21"> Save me from the mouth of the lion! You have rescued me from the horns of the wild oxen!</verse>
    <verse value="22"> I will tell of your name to my brothers; in the midst of the congregation I will praise you:</verse>
    <verse value="23"> You who fear the LORD, praise him! All you offspring of Jacob, glorify him, and stand in awe of him, all you offspring of Israel!</verse>
    <verse value="24"> For he has not despised or abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, and he has not hidden his face from him, but has heard, when he cried to him.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> From you comes my praise in the great congregation; my vows I will perform before those who fear him.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> The afflicted shall eat and be satisfied; those who seek him shall praise the LORD! May your hearts live forever!</verse>
    <verse value="27"> All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD, and all the families of the nations shall worship before you.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> For kingship belongs to the LORD, and he rules over the nations.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> All the prosperous of the earth eat and worship; before him shall bow all who go down to the dust, even the one who could not keep himself alive.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Posterity shall serve him; it shall be told of the Lord to the coming generation;</verse>
    <verse value="31"> they shall come and proclaim his righteousness to a people yet unborn, that he has done it.</verse>
