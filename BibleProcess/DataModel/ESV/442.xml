    <verse value="1">Then Job answered and said:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Oh that my vexation were weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances!</verse>
    <verse value="3"> For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore my words have been rash.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> For the arrows of the Almighty are in me; my spirit drinks their poison; the terrors of God are arrayed against me.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass, or the ox low over his fodder?</verse>
    <verse value="6"> Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt, or is there any taste in the juice of the mallow?</verse>
    <verse value="7"> My appetite refuses to touch them; they are as food that is loathsome to me.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> "Oh that I might have my request, and that God would fulfill my hope,</verse>
    <verse value="9"> that it would please God to crush me, that he would let loose his hand and cut me off!</verse>
    <verse value="10"> This would be my comfort; I would even exult in pain unsparing, for I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should be patient?</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh bronze?</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Have I any help in me, when resource is driven from me?</verse>
    <verse value="14"> "He who withholds kindness from a friend forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> My brothers are treacherous as a torrent-bed, as torrential streams that pass away,</verse>
    <verse value="16"> which are dark with ice, and where the snow hides itself.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> When they melt, they disappear; when it is hot, they vanish from their place.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> The caravans turn aside from their course; they go up into the waste and perish.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> The caravans of Tema look, the travelers of Sheba hope.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> They are ashamed because they were confident; they come there and are disappointed.</verse>
    <verse value="21"> For you have now become nothing; you see my calamity and are afraid.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Have I said, 'Make me a gift'? Or, 'From your wealth offer a bribe for me'?</verse>
    <verse value="23"> Or, 'Deliver me from the adversary's hand'? Or, 'Redeem me from the hand of the ruthless'?</verse>
    <verse value="24"> "Teach me, and I will be silent; make me understand how I have gone astray.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> How forceful are upright words! But what does reproof from you reprove?</verse>
    <verse value="26"> Do you think that you can reprove words, when the speech of a despairing man is wind?</verse>
    <verse value="27"> You would even cast lots over the fatherless, and bargain over your friend.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> "But now, be pleased to look at me, for I will not lie to your face.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> Please turn; let no injustice be done. Turn now; my vindication is at stake.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> Is there any injustice on my tongue? Cannot my palate discern the cause of calamity?</verse>
