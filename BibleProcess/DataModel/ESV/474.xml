    <verse value="1">Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:</verse>
    <verse value="2"> "Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?</verse>
    <verse value="3"> Dress for action like a man; I will question you, and you make it known to me.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> "Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Who determined its measurements--surely you know! Or who stretched the line upon it?</verse>
    <verse value="6"> On what were its bases sunk, or who laid its cornerstone,</verse>
    <verse value="7"> when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</verse>
    <verse value="8"> "Or who shut in the sea with doors when it burst out from the womb,</verse>
    <verse value="9"> when I made clouds its garment and thick darkness its swaddling band,</verse>
    <verse value="10"> and prescribed limits for it and set bars and doors,</verse>
    <verse value="11"> and said, 'Thus far shall you come, and no farther, and here shall your proud waves be stayed'?</verse>
    <verse value="12"> "Have you commanded the morning since your days began, and caused the dawn to know its place,</verse>
    <verse value="13"> that it might take hold of the skirts of the earth, and the wicked be shaken out of it?</verse>
    <verse value="14"> It is changed like clay under the seal, and its features stand out like a garment.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> From the wicked their light is withheld, and their uplifted arm is broken.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> "Have you entered into the springs of the sea, or walked in the recesses of the deep?</verse>
    <verse value="17"> Have the gates of death been revealed to you, or have you seen the gates of deep darkness?</verse>
    <verse value="18"> Have you comprehended the expanse of the earth? Declare, if you know all this.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> "Where is the way to the dwelling of light, and where is the place of darkness,</verse>
    <verse value="20"> that you may take it to its territory and that you may discern the paths to its home?</verse>
    <verse value="21"> You know, for you were born then, and the number of your days is great!</verse>
    <verse value="22"> "Have you entered the storehouses of the snow, or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,</verse>
    <verse value="23"> which I have reserved for the time of trouble, for the day of battle and war?</verse>
    <verse value="24"> What is the way to the place where the light is distributed, or where the east wind is scattered upon the earth?</verse>
    <verse value="25"> "Who has cleft a channel for the torrents of rain and a way for the thunderbolt,</verse>
    <verse value="26"> to bring rain on a land where no man is, on the desert in which there is no man,</verse>
    <verse value="27"> to satisfy the waste and desolate land, and to make the ground sprout with grass?</verse>
    <verse value="28"> "Has the rain a father, or who has begotten the drops of dew?</verse>
    <verse value="29"> From whose womb did the ice come forth, and who has given birth to the frost of heaven?</verse>
    <verse value="30"> The waters become hard like stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> "Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades or loose the cords of Orion?</verse>
    <verse value="32"> Can you lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season, or can you guide the Bear with its children?</verse>
    <verse value="33"> Do you know the ordinances of the heavens? Can you establish their rule on the earth?</verse>
    <verse value="34"> "Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, that a flood of waters may cover you?</verse>
    <verse value="35"> Can you send forth lightnings, that they may go and say to you, 'Here we are'?</verse>
    <verse value="36"> Who has put wisdom in the inward parts or given understanding to the mind?</verse>
    <verse value="37"> Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can tilt the waterskins of the heavens,</verse>
    <verse value="38"> when the dust runs into a mass and the clods stick fast together?</verse>
    <verse value="39"> "Can you hunt the prey for the lion, or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,</verse>
    <verse value="40"> when they crouch in their dens or lie in wait in their thicket?</verse>
    <verse value="41"> Who provides for the raven its prey, when its young ones cry to God for help, and wander about for lack of food?</verse>
