    <verse value="1">[A Psalm. A Song for the Sabbath.] It is good to give thanks to the LORD, to sing praises to your name, O Most High;</verse>
    <verse value="2"> to declare your steadfast love in the morning, and your faithfulness by night,</verse>
    <verse value="3"> to the music of the lute and the harp, to the melody of the lyre.</verse>
    <verse value="4"> For you, O LORD, have made me glad by your work; at the works of your hands I sing for joy.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> How great are your works, O LORD! Your thoughts are very deep!</verse>
    <verse value="6"> The stupid man cannot know; the fool cannot understand this:</verse>
    <verse value="7"> that though the wicked sprout like grass and all evildoers flourish, they are doomed to destruction forever;</verse>
    <verse value="8"> but you, O LORD, are on high forever.</verse>
    <verse value="9"> For behold, your enemies, O LORD, for behold, your enemies shall perish; all evildoers shall be scattered.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox; you have poured over me fresh oil.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies; my ears have heard the doom of my evil assailants.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> The righteous flourish like the palm tree and grow like a cedar in Lebanon.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> They are planted in the house of the LORD; they flourish in the courts of our God.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> They still bear fruit in old age; they are ever full of sap and green,</verse>
    <verse value="15"> to declare that the LORD is upright; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.</verse>
