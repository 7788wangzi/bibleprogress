    <verse value="1">[A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite.] I will sing of the steadfast love of the LORD, forever; with my mouth I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.</verse>
    <verse value="2"> For I said, "Steadfast love will be built up forever; in the heavens you will establish your faithfulness."</verse>
    <verse value="3"> You have said, "I have made a covenant with my chosen one; I have sworn to David my servant:</verse>
    <verse value="4"> 'I will establish your offspring forever, and build your throne for all generations.'" Selah</verse>
    <verse value="5"> Let the heavens praise your wonders, O LORD, your faithfulness in the assembly of the holy ones!</verse>
    <verse value="6"> For who in the skies can be compared to the LORD? Who among the heavenly beings is like the LORD,</verse>
    <verse value="7"> a God greatly to be feared in the council of the holy ones, and awesome above all who are around him?</verse>
    <verse value="8"> O LORD God of hosts, who is mighty as you are, O LORD, with your faithfulness all around you?</verse>
    <verse value="9"> You rule the raging of the sea; when its waves rise, you still them.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> You crushed Rahab like a carcass; you scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> The heavens are yours; the earth also is yours; the world and all that is in it, you have founded them.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> The north and the south, you have created them; Tabor and Hermon joyously praise your name.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> You have a mighty arm; strong is your hand, high your right hand.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; steadfast love and faithfulness go before you.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> Blessed are the people who know the festal shout, who walk, O LORD, in the light of your face,</verse>
    <verse value="16"> who exult in your name all the day and in your righteousness are exalted.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> For you are the glory of their strength; by your favor our horn is exalted.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> For our shield belongs to the LORD, our king to the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> Of old you spoke in a vision to your godly one, and said: "I have granted help to one who is mighty; I have exalted one chosen from the people.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> I have found David, my servant; with my holy oil I have anointed him,</verse>
    <verse value="21"> so that my hand shall be established with him; my arm also shall strengthen him.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> The enemy shall not outwit him; the wicked shall not humble him.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> I will crush his foes before him and strike down those who hate him.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> My faithfulness and my steadfast love shall be with him, and in my name shall his horn be exalted.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> I will set his hand on the sea and his right hand on the rivers.</verse>
    <verse value="26"> He shall cry to me, 'You are my Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation.'</verse>
    <verse value="27"> And I will make him the firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> My steadfast love I will keep for him forever, and my covenant will stand firm for him.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> I will establish his offspring forever and his throne as the days of the heavens.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> If his children forsake my law and do not walk according to my rules,</verse>
    <verse value="31"> if they violate my statutes and do not keep my commandments,</verse>
    <verse value="32"> then I will punish their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes,</verse>
    <verse value="33"> but I will not remove from him my steadfast love or be false to my faithfulness.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> I will not violate my covenant or alter the word that went forth from my lips.</verse>
    <verse value="35"> Once for all I have sworn by my holiness; I will not lie to David.</verse>
    <verse value="36"> His offspring shall endure forever, his throne as long as the sun before me.</verse>
    <verse value="37"> Like the moon it shall be established forever, a faithful witness in the skies." Selah</verse>
    <verse value="38"> But now you have cast off and rejected; you are full of wrath against your anointed.</verse>
    <verse value="39"> You have renounced the covenant with your servant; you have defiled his crown in the dust.</verse>
    <verse value="40"> You have breached all his walls; you have laid his strongholds in ruins.</verse>
    <verse value="41"> All who pass by plunder him; he has become the scorn of his neighbors.</verse>
    <verse value="42"> You have exalted the right hand of his foes; you have made all his enemies rejoice.</verse>
    <verse value="43"> You have also turned back the edge of his sword, and you have not made him stand in battle.</verse>
    <verse value="44"> You have made his splendor to cease and cast his throne to the ground.</verse>
    <verse value="45"> You have cut short the days of his youth; you have covered him with shame. Selah</verse>
    <verse value="46"> How long, O LORD? Will you hide yourself forever? How long will your wrath burn like fire?</verse>
    <verse value="47"> Remember how short my time is! For what vanity you have created all the children of man!</verse>
    <verse value="48"> What man can live and never see death? Who can deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah</verse>
    <verse value="49"> Lord, where is your steadfast love of old, which by your faithfulness you swore to David?</verse>
    <verse value="50"> Remember, O Lord, how your servants are mocked, and how I bear in my heart the insults of all the many nations,</verse>
    <verse value="51"> with which your enemies mock, O LORD, with which they mock the footsteps of your anointed.</verse>
    <verse value="52"> Blessed be the LORD forever! Amen and Amen.</verse>
