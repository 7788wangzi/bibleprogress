    <verse value="1">Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness. </verse>
    <verse value="2"> For we all stumble in many ways. And if anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle his whole body. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> If we put bits into the mouths of horses so that they obey us, we guide their whole bodies as well. </verse>
    <verse value="4"> Look at the ships also: though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs.</verse>
    <verse value="5"> So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great things. How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire! </verse>
    <verse value="6"> And the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness. The tongue is set among our members, staining the whole body, setting on fire the entire course of life, and set on fire by hell. </verse>
    <verse value="7"> For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind,</verse>
    <verse value="8"> but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God. </verse>
    <verse value="10"> From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so. </verse>
    <verse value="11"> Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and salt water?</verse>
    <verse value="12"> Can a fig tree, my brothers, bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt pond yield fresh water.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic. </verse>
    <verse value="16"> For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere. </verse>
    <verse value="18"> And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.</verse>
