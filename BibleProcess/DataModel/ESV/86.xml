    <verse value="1">"Bezalel and Oholiab and every craftsman in whom the LORD has put skill and intelligence to know how to do any work in the construction of the sanctuary shall work in accordance with all that the LORD has commanded."</verse>
    <verse value="2"> And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every craftsman in whose mind the LORD had put skill, everyone whose heart stirred him up to come to do the work. </verse>
    <verse value="3"> And they received from Moses all the contribution that the people of Israel had brought for doing the work on the sanctuary. They still kept bringing him freewill offerings every morning, </verse>
    <verse value="4"> so that all the craftsmen who were doing every sort of task on the sanctuary came, each from the task that he was doing,</verse>
    <verse value="5"> and said to Moses, "The people bring much more than enough for doing the work that the LORD has commanded us to do." </verse>
    <verse value="6"> So Moses gave command, and word was proclaimed throughout the camp, "Let no man or woman do anything more for the contribution for the sanctuary." So the people were restrained from bringing, </verse>
    <verse value="7"> for the material they had was sufficient to do all the work, and more.</verse>
    <verse value="8"> And all the craftsmen among the workmen made the tabernacle with ten curtains. They were made of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet yarns, with cherubim skillfully worked. </verse>
    <verse value="9"> The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits. All the curtains were the same size.</verse>
    <verse value="10"> He coupled five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he coupled to one another.</verse>
    <verse value="11"> He made loops of blue on the edge of the outermost curtain of the first set. Likewise he made them on the edge of the outermost curtain of the second set.</verse>
    <verse value="12"> He made fifty loops on the one curtain, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set. The loops were opposite one another.</verse>
    <verse value="13"> And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to the other with clasps. So the tabernacle was a single whole.</verse>
    <verse value="14"> He also made curtains of goats' hair for a tent over the tabernacle. He made eleven curtains.</verse>
    <verse value="15"> The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits. The eleven curtains were the same size.</verse>
    <verse value="16"> He coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.</verse>
    <verse value="17"> And he made fifty loops on the edge of the outermost curtain of the one set, and fifty loops on the edge of the other connecting curtain.</verse>
    <verse value="18"> And he made fifty clasps of bronze to couple the tent together that it might be a single whole.</verse>
    <verse value="19"> And he made for the tent a covering of tanned rams' skins and goatskins.</verse>
    <verse value="20"> Then he made the upright frames for the tabernacle of acacia wood. </verse>
    <verse value="21"> Ten cubits was the length of a frame, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each frame.</verse>
    <verse value="22"> Each frame had two tenons for fitting together. He did this for all the frames of the tabernacle.</verse>
    <verse value="23"> The frames for the tabernacle he made thus: twenty frames for the south side.</verse>
    <verse value="24"> And he made forty bases of silver under the twenty frames, two bases under one frame for its two tenons, and two bases under the next frame for its two tenons.</verse>
    <verse value="25"> For the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty frames</verse>
    <verse value="26"> and their forty bases of silver, two bases under one frame and two bases under the next frame.</verse>
    <verse value="27"> For the rear of the tabernacle westward he made six frames.</verse>
    <verse value="28"> He made two frames for corners of the tabernacle in the rear.</verse>
    <verse value="29"> And they were separate beneath but joined at the top, at the first ring. He made two of them this way for the two corners.</verse>
    <verse value="30"> There were eight frames with their bases of silver: sixteen bases, under every frame two bases.</verse>
    <verse value="31"> He made bars of acacia wood, five for the frames of the one side of the tabernacle,</verse>
    <verse value="32"> and five bars for the frames of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the frames of the tabernacle at the rear westward.</verse>
    <verse value="33"> And he made the middle bar to run from end to end halfway up the frames.</verse>
    <verse value="34"> And he overlaid the frames with gold, and made their rings of gold for holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.</verse>
    <verse value="35"> He made the veil of blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen; with cherubim skillfully worked into it he made it. </verse>
    <verse value="36"> And for it he made four pillars of acacia and overlaid them with gold. Their hooks were of gold, and he cast for them four bases of silver.</verse>
    <verse value="37"> He also made a screen for the entrance of the tent, of blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen, embroidered with needlework,</verse>
    <verse value="38"> and its five pillars with their hooks. He overlaid their capitals, and their fillets were of gold, but their five bases were of bronze.</verse>
