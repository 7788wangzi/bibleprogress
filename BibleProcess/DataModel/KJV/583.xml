    <verse value="1">O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.</verse>
    <verse value="2">Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.</verse>
    <verse value="3">Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.</verse>
    <verse value="4">Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.</verse>
    <verse value="5">Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;</verse>
    <verse value="6">O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.</verse>
    <verse value="7">He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="8">He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.</verse>
    <verse value="9">Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;</verse>
    <verse value="10">And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:</verse>
    <verse value="11">Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:</verse>
    <verse value="12">When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.</verse>
    <verse value="13">When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;</verse>
    <verse value="14">He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;</verse>
    <verse value="15">Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</verse>
    <verse value="16">Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.</verse>
    <verse value="17">He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:</verse>
    <verse value="18">Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:</verse>
    <verse value="19">Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.</verse>
    <verse value="20">The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.</verse>
    <verse value="21">He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:</verse>
    <verse value="22">To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.</verse>
    <verse value="23">Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</verse>
    <verse value="24">And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.</verse>
    <verse value="25">He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.</verse>
    <verse value="26">He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.</verse>
    <verse value="27">They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.</verse>
    <verse value="28">He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.</verse>
    <verse value="29">He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.</verse>
    <verse value="30">Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.</verse>
    <verse value="31">He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts.</verse>
    <verse value="32">He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.</verse>
    <verse value="33">He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.</verse>
    <verse value="34">He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,</verse>
    <verse value="35">And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.</verse>
    <verse value="36">He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.</verse>
    <verse value="37">He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.</verse>
    <verse value="38">Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.</verse>
    <verse value="39">He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.</verse>
    <verse value="40">The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</verse>
    <verse value="41">He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.</verse>
    <verse value="42">For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.</verse>
    <verse value="43">And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:</verse>
    <verse value="44">And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;</verse>
    <verse value="45">That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.</verse>
