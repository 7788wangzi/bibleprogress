    <verse value="1">Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</verse>
    <verse value="2">To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</verse>
    <verse value="3">For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</verse>
    <verse value="4">But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</verse>
    <verse value="5">Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</verse>
    <verse value="6">Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</verse>
    <verse value="7">That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</verse>
    <verse value="8">This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</verse>
    <verse value="9">But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</verse>
    <verse value="10">A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;</verse>
    <verse value="11">Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</verse>
    <verse value="12">When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</verse>
    <verse value="13">Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</verse>
    <verse value="14">And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</verse>
    <verse value="15">All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen. &lt;It was written to Titus, ordained the first bishop of the church of the Cretians, from Nicopolis of Macedonia.&gt;</verse>
