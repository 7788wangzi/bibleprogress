    <verse value="1">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</verse>
    <verse value="2">How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?</verse>
    <verse value="3">Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?</verse>
    <verse value="4">If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;</verse>
    <verse value="5">If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;</verse>
    <verse value="6">If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.</verse>
    <verse value="7">Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.</verse>
    <verse value="8">For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:</verse>
    <verse value="9">(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)</verse>
    <verse value="10">Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?</verse>
    <verse value="11">Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?</verse>
    <verse value="12">Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.</verse>
    <verse value="13">So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite\'s hope shall perish:</verse>
    <verse value="14">Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider\'s web.</verse>
    <verse value="15">He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.</verse>
    <verse value="16">He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.</verse>
    <verse value="17">His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.</verse>
    <verse value="18">If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.</verse>
    <verse value="19">Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.</verse>
    <verse value="20">Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:</verse>
    <verse value="21">Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.</verse>
    <verse value="22">They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.</verse>
