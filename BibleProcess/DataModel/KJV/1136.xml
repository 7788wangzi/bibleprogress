    <verse value="1">Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</verse>
    <verse value="2">Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.</verse>
    <verse value="3">For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.</verse>
    <verse value="4">For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.</verse>
    <verse value="5">And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</verse>
    <verse value="6">But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</verse>
    <verse value="7">Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,</verse>
    <verse value="8">Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</verse>
    <verse value="9">When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</verse>
    <verse value="10">Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.</verse>
    <verse value="11">So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)</verse>
    <verse value="12">Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</verse>
    <verse value="13">But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</verse>
    <verse value="14">For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;</verse>
    <verse value="15">While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</verse>
    <verse value="16">For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</verse>
    <verse value="17">But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?</verse>
    <verse value="18">And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?</verse>
    <verse value="19">So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</verse>
