    <verse value="1">Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</verse>
    <verse value="2">And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.</verse>
    <verse value="3">They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</verse>
    <verse value="4">But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</verse>
    <verse value="5">While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</verse>
    <verse value="6">And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.</verse>
    <verse value="7">Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</verse>
    <verse value="8">And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</verse>
    <verse value="9">But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</verse>
    <verse value="10">And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</verse>
    <verse value="11">Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</verse>
    <verse value="12">But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</verse>
    <verse value="13">Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</verse>
    <verse value="14">For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</verse>
    <verse value="15">And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</verse>
    <verse value="16">Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.</verse>
    <verse value="17">And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.</verse>
    <verse value="18">But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.</verse>
    <verse value="19">After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</verse>
    <verse value="20">And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</verse>
    <verse value="21">His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</verse>
    <verse value="22">He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</verse>
    <verse value="23">His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</verse>
    <verse value="24">Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</verse>
    <verse value="25">And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.</verse>
    <verse value="26">His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:</verse>
    <verse value="27">Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</verse>
    <verse value="28">Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.</verse>
    <verse value="29">For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.</verse>
    <verse value="30">And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
    <verse value="31">When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</verse>
    <verse value="32">And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:</verse>
    <verse value="33">And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</verse>
    <verse value="34">Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</verse>
    <verse value="35">For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</verse>
    <verse value="36">Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</verse>
    <verse value="37">Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</verse>
    <verse value="38">When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</verse>
    <verse value="39">Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</verse>
    <verse value="40">And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</verse>
    <verse value="41">Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</verse>
    <verse value="42">For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:</verse>
    <verse value="43">I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</verse>
    <verse value="44">Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</verse>
    <verse value="45">Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.</verse>
    <verse value="46">And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</verse>
