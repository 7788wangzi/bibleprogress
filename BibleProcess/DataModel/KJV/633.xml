    <verse value="1">My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding:</verse>
    <verse value="2">That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.</verse>
    <verse value="3">For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:</verse>
    <verse value="4">But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.</verse>
    <verse value="5">Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.</verse>
    <verse value="6">Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.</verse>
    <verse value="7">Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</verse>
    <verse value="8">Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:</verse>
    <verse value="9">Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:</verse>
    <verse value="10">Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger;</verse>
    <verse value="11">And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</verse>
    <verse value="12">And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</verse>
    <verse value="13">And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!</verse>
    <verse value="14">I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.</verse>
    <verse value="15">Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.</verse>
    <verse value="16">Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.</verse>
    <verse value="17">Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.</verse>
    <verse value="18">Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.</verse>
    <verse value="19">Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.</verse>
    <verse value="20">And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</verse>
    <verse value="21">For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.</verse>
    <verse value="22">His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.</verse>
    <verse value="23">He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</verse>
