    <verse value="1">These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.</verse>
    <verse value="2">It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter.</verse>
    <verse value="3">The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.</verse>
    <verse value="4">Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.</verse>
    <verse value="5">Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.</verse>
    <verse value="6">Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men:</verse>
    <verse value="7">For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.</verse>
    <verse value="8">Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.</verse>
    <verse value="9">Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another:</verse>
    <verse value="10">Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.</verse>
    <verse value="11">A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.</verse>
    <verse value="12">As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.</verse>
    <verse value="13">As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.</verse>
    <verse value="14">Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.</verse>
    <verse value="15">By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.</verse>
    <verse value="16">Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.</verse>
    <verse value="17">Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee.</verse>
    <verse value="18">A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.</verse>
    <verse value="19">Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.</verse>
    <verse value="20">As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.</verse>
    <verse value="21">If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:</verse>
    <verse value="22">For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.</verse>
    <verse value="23">The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.</verse>
    <verse value="24">It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.</verse>
    <verse value="25">As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.</verse>
    <verse value="26">A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.</verse>
    <verse value="27">It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory.</verse>
    <verse value="28">He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.</verse>
