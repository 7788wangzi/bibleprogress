    <verse value="1">A Song of degrees. LORD, remember David, and all his afflictions:</verse>
    <verse value="2">How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;</verse>
    <verse value="3">Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;</verse>
    <verse value="4">I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,</verse>
    <verse value="5">Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.</verse>
    <verse value="6">Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.</verse>
    <verse value="7">We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.</verse>
    <verse value="8">Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.</verse>
    <verse value="9">Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.</verse>
    <verse value="10">For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.</verse>
    <verse value="11">The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.</verse>
    <verse value="12">If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.</verse>
    <verse value="13">For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.</verse>
    <verse value="14">This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.</verse>
    <verse value="15">I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.</verse>
    <verse value="16">I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.</verse>
    <verse value="17">There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.</verse>
    <verse value="18">His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.</verse>
