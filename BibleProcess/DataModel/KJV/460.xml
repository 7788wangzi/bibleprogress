    <verse value="4">They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.</verse>
    <verse value="5">Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children.</verse>
    <verse value="6">They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.</verse>
    <verse value="7">They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.</verse>

    <verse value="14">The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.</verse>
    <verse value="15">The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.</verse>
    <verse value="16">In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.</verse>
    <verse value="17">For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.</verse>
    <verse value="18">He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.</verse>
    <verse value="19">Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned.</verse>
    <verse value="20">The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.</verse>
    <verse value="21">He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.</verse>
    <verse value="22">He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life.</verse>
    <verse value="23">Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways.</verse>
    <verse value="24">They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.</verse>
    <verse value="25">And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?</verse>
