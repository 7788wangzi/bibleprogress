    <verse value="1">&lt;A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.&gt; O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;</verse>
    <verse value="2">To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary.</verse>
    <verse value="3">Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.</verse>
    <verse value="4">Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.</verse>
    <verse value="5">My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:</verse>
    <verse value="6">When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.</verse>
    <verse value="7">Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.</verse>
    <verse value="8">My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.</verse>
    <verse value="9">But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="10">They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.</verse>
    <verse value="11">But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.</verse>
