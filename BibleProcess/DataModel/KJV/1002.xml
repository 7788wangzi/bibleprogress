    <verse value="1">After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse value="2">Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</verse>
    <verse value="3">In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</verse>
    <verse value="4">For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</verse>
    <verse value="5">And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</verse>
    <verse value="6">When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?</verse>
    <verse value="7">The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</verse>
    <verse value="8">Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</verse>
    <verse value="9">And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</verse>
    <verse value="10">The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.</verse>
    <verse value="11">He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</verse>
    <verse value="12">Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</verse>
    <verse value="13">And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.</verse>
    <verse value="14">Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</verse>
    <verse value="15">The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.</verse>
    <verse value="16">And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.</verse>
    <verse value="17">But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</verse>
    <verse value="18">Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</verse>
    <verse value="19">Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</verse>
    <verse value="20">For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.</verse>
    <verse value="21">For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.</verse>
    <verse value="22">For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:</verse>
    <verse value="23">That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.</verse>
    <verse value="24">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</verse>
    <verse value="25">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</verse>
    <verse value="26">For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</verse>
    <verse value="27">And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</verse>
    <verse value="28">Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</verse>
    <verse value="29">And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</verse>
    <verse value="30">I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.</verse>
    <verse value="31">If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</verse>
    <verse value="32">There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</verse>
    <verse value="33">Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.</verse>
    <verse value="34">But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.</verse>
    <verse value="35">He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</verse>
    <verse value="36">But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</verse>
    <verse value="37">And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</verse>
    <verse value="38">And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.</verse>
    <verse value="39">Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</verse>
    <verse value="40">And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</verse>
    <verse value="41">I receive not honour from men.</verse>
    <verse value="42">But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</verse>
    <verse value="43">I am come in my Father\'s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</verse>
    <verse value="44">How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?</verse>
    <verse value="45">Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.</verse>
    <verse value="46">For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.</verse>
    <verse value="47">But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</verse>
