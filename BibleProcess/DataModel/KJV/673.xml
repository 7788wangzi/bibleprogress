    <verse value="1">I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.</verse>
    <verse value="2">As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.</verse>
    <verse value="3">As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.</verse>
    <verse value="4">He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.</verse>
    <verse value="5">Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.</verse>
    <verse value="6">His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.</verse>
    <verse value="7">I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.</verse>
    <verse value="8">The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.</verse>
    <verse value="9">My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice.</verse>
    <verse value="10">My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.</verse>
    <verse value="11">For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;</verse>
    <verse value="12">The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;</verse>
    <verse value="13">The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.</verse>
    <verse value="14">O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</verse>
    <verse value="15">Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.</verse>
    <verse value="16">My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.</verse>
    <verse value="17">Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.</verse>
