    <verse value="1">At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.</verse>
    <verse value="2">Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.</verse>
    <verse value="3">He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="4">After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.</verse>
    <verse value="5">God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.</verse>
    <verse value="6">For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.</verse>
    <verse value="7">He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.</verse>
    <verse value="8">Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.</verse>
    <verse value="9">Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.</verse>
    <verse value="10">By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.</verse>
    <verse value="11">Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:</verse>
    <verse value="12">And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="13">He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.</verse>
    <verse value="14">Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</verse>
    <verse value="15">Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?</verse>
    <verse value="16">Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?</verse>
    <verse value="17">How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?</verse>
    <verse value="18">Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?</verse>
    <verse value="19">Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.</verse>
    <verse value="20">Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.</verse>
    <verse value="21">And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.</verse>
    <verse value="22">Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.</verse>
    <verse value="23">Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.</verse>
    <verse value="24">Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.</verse>
