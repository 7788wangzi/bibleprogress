    <verse value="1">My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</verse>
    <verse value="2">Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.</verse>
    <verse value="3">Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.</verse>
    <verse value="4">Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:</verse>
    <verse value="5">That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.</verse>
    <verse value="6">For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,</verse>
    <verse value="7">And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,</verse>
    <verse value="8">Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,</verse>
    <verse value="9">In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:</verse>
    <verse value="10">And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.</verse>
    <verse value="11">(She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:</verse>
    <verse value="12">Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)</verse>
    <verse value="13">So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,</verse>
    <verse value="14">I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.</verse>
    <verse value="15">Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</verse>
    <verse value="16">I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse value="17">I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</verse>
    <verse value="18">Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.</verse>
    <verse value="19">For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:</verse>
    <verse value="20">He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.</verse>
    <verse value="21">With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.</verse>
    <verse value="22">He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;</verse>
    <verse value="23">Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.</verse>
    <verse value="24">Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.</verse>
    <verse value="25">Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.</verse>
    <verse value="26">For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.</verse>
    <verse value="27">Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.</verse>
