    <verse value="1">My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,</verse>
    <verse value="2">Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</verse>
    <verse value="3">Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.</verse>
    <verse value="4">Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.</verse>
    <verse value="5">Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</verse>
    <verse value="6">Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:</verse>
    <verse value="7">Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,</verse>
    <verse value="8">Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.</verse>
    <verse value="9">How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</verse>
    <verse value="10">Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</verse>
    <verse value="11">So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</verse>
    <verse value="12">A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.</verse>
    <verse value="13">He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;</verse>
    <verse value="14">Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.</verse>
    <verse value="15">Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.</verse>
    <verse value="16">These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:</verse>
    <verse value="17">A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</verse>
    <verse value="18">An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,</verse>
    <verse value="19">A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.</verse>
    <verse value="20">My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</verse>
    <verse value="21">Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.</verse>
    <verse value="22">When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</verse>
    <verse value="23">For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:</verse>
    <verse value="24">To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.</verse>
    <verse value="25">Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.</verse>
    <verse value="26">For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.</verse>
    <verse value="27">Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?</verse>
    <verse value="28">Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?</verse>
    <verse value="29">So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.</verse>
    <verse value="30">Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;</verse>
    <verse value="31">But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.</verse>
    <verse value="32">But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.</verse>
    <verse value="33">A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</verse>
    <verse value="34">For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</verse>
    <verse value="35">He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</verse>
