    <verse value="1">Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:</verse>
    <verse value="2">She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.</verse>
    <verse value="3">She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,</verse>
    <verse value="4">Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</verse>
    <verse value="5">Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.</verse>
    <verse value="6">Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.</verse>
    <verse value="7">He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.</verse>
    <verse value="8">Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.</verse>
    <verse value="9">Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.</verse>
    <verse value="10">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.</verse>
    <verse value="11">For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.</verse>
    <verse value="12">If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.</verse>
    <verse value="13">A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.</verse>
    <verse value="14">For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,</verse>
    <verse value="15">To call passengers who go right on their ways:</verse>
    <verse value="16">Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</verse>
    <verse value="17">Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.</verse>
    <verse value="18">But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell.</verse>
