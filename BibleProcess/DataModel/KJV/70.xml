    <verse value="11">For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</verse>

    <verse value="19">And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.</verse>
    <verse value="20">And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.</verse>
    <verse value="21">And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.</verse>
    <verse value="22">And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.</verse>

    <verse value="24">An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.</verse>
    <verse value="25">And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.</verse>
    <verse value="26">Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.</verse>
