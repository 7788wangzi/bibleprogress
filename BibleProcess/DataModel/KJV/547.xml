    <verse value="1">&lt;To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, A Psalm of David.&gt; Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.</verse>
    <verse value="2">I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.</verse>
    <verse value="3">I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.</verse>
    <verse value="4">They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.</verse>
    <verse value="5">O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.</verse>
    <verse value="6">Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.</verse>
    <verse value="7">Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.</verse>
    <verse value="8">I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.</verse>
    <verse value="9">For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</verse>
    <verse value="10">When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.</verse>
    <verse value="11">I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.</verse>
    <verse value="12">They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.</verse>
    <verse value="13">But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.</verse>
    <verse value="14">Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.</verse>
    <verse value="15">Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.</verse>
    <verse value="16">Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</verse>
    <verse value="17">And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.</verse>
    <verse value="18">Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.</verse>
    <verse value="19">Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.</verse>
    <verse value="20">Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.</verse>
    <verse value="21">They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</verse>
    <verse value="22">Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.</verse>
    <verse value="23">Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.</verse>
    <verse value="24">Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.</verse>
    <verse value="25">Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.</verse>
    <verse value="26">For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.</verse>
    <verse value="27">Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.</verse>
    <verse value="28">Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.</verse>
    <verse value="29">But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.</verse>
    <verse value="30">I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.</verse>
    <verse value="31">This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.</verse>
    <verse value="32">The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.</verse>
    <verse value="33">For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.</verse>
    <verse value="34">Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.</verse>
    <verse value="35">For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.</verse>
    <verse value="36">The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.</verse>
