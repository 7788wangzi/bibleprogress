    <verse value="1">Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,</verse>
    <verse value="2">Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;</verse>
    <verse value="3">When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness;</verse>
    <verse value="4">As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;</verse>
    <verse value="5">When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;</verse>
    <verse value="6">When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;</verse>
    <verse value="7">When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!</verse>
    <verse value="8">The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up.</verse>
    <verse value="9">The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.</verse>
    <verse value="10">The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.</verse>
    <verse value="11">When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:</verse>
    <verse value="12">Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.</verse>
    <verse value="13">The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow\'s heart to sing for joy.</verse>
    <verse value="14">I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem.</verse>
    <verse value="15">I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.</verse>
    <verse value="16">I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.</verse>
    <verse value="17">And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.</verse>
    <verse value="18">Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.</verse>
    <verse value="19">My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.</verse>
    <verse value="20">My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.</verse>
    <verse value="21">Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.</verse>
    <verse value="22">After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.</verse>
    <verse value="23">And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.</verse>
    <verse value="24">If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.</verse>
    <verse value="25">I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.</verse>
