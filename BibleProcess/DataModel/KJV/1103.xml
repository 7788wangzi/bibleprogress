    <verse value="1">Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.</verse>
    <verse value="2">Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)</verse>
    <verse value="3">That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="4">And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</verse>
    <verse value="5">Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;</verse>
    <verse value="6">Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;</verse>
    <verse value="7">With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:</verse>
    <verse value="8">Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.</verse>
    <verse value="9">And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.</verse>
    <verse value="10">Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</verse>
    <verse value="11">Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.</verse>
    <verse value="12">For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</verse>
    <verse value="13">Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</verse>
    <verse value="14">Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;</verse>
    <verse value="15">And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;</verse>
    <verse value="16">Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</verse>
    <verse value="17">And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:</verse>
    <verse value="18">Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;</verse>
    <verse value="19">And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,</verse>
    <verse value="20">For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.</verse>
    <verse value="21">But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:</verse>
    <verse value="22">Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.</verse>
    <verse value="23">Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
    <verse value="24">Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen. &lt;To the Ephesians written from Rome, by Tychicus.&gt;</verse>
