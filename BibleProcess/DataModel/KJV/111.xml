    <verse value="2">But for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother,</verse>
    <verse value="3">And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no husband; for her may he be defiled.</verse>
    <verse value="4">But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.</verse>
    <verse value="5">They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.</verse>
    <verse value="6">They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.</verse>
    <verse value="7">They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God.</verse>
    <verse value="8">Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, am holy.</verse>
    <verse value="9">And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.</verse>
    <verse value="10">And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;</verse>
    <verse value="11">Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;</verse>
    <verse value="12">Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the LORD.</verse>
    <verse value="13">And he shall take a wife in her virginity.</verse>
    <verse value="14">A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife.</verse>
    <verse value="15">Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the LORD do sanctify him.</verse>
    <verse value="16">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</verse>
    <verse value="17">Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.</verse>
    <verse value="18">For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous,</verse>
    <verse value="19">Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,</verse>
    <verse value="20">Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;</verse>
    <verse value="21">No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.</verse>
    <verse value="22">He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.</verse>
    <verse value="23">Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.</verse>
    <verse value="24">And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.</verse>
