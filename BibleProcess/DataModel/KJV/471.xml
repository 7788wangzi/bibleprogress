    <verse value="1">Elihu spake moreover, and said,</verse>
    <verse value="2">Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God\'s?</verse>
    <verse value="3">For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?</verse>
    <verse value="4">I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.</verse>
    <verse value="5">Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.</verse>
    <verse value="6">If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?</verse>
    <verse value="7">If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?</verse>
    <verse value="8">Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.</verse>
    <verse value="9">By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.</verse>
    <verse value="10">But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;</verse>
    <verse value="11">Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?</verse>
    <verse value="12">There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.</verse>
    <verse value="13">Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.</verse>
    <verse value="14">Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.</verse>
    <verse value="15">But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:</verse>
    <verse value="16">Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.</verse>
