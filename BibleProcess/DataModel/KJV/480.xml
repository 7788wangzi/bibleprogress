    <verse value="4">He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.</verse>
    <verse value="5">Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.</verse>
    <verse value="6">Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.</verse>
    <verse value="7">I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.</verse>
    <verse value="8">Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.</verse>
    <verse value="9">Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</verse>
