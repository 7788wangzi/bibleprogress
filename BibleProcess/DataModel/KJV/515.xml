    <verse value="2">For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.</verse>

    <verse value="14">The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation.</verse>
    <verse value="15">Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.</verse>
    <verse value="16">A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.</verse>

    <verse value="21">The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.</verse>
    <verse value="22">For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.</verse>
    <verse value="23">The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.</verse>
    <verse value="24">Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand.</verse>
    <verse value="25">I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.</verse>

    <verse value="27">Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.</verse>

    <verse value="31">The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.</verse>
    <verse value="32">The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.</verse>
    <verse value="33">The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.</verse>
    <verse value="34">Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.</verse>
    <verse value="35">I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.</verse>
    <verse value="36">Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.</verse>
    <verse value="37">Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.</verse>
    <verse value="38">But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.</verse>
    <verse value="39">But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble.</verse>
    <verse value="40">And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.</verse>
