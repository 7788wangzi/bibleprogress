    <verse value="1">And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.</verse>
    <verse value="2">And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.</verse>
    <verse value="3">And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.</verse>
    <verse value="4">And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.</verse>
    <verse value="5">And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</verse>
    <verse value="6">And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</verse>
    <verse value="7">But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,</verse>
    <verse value="8">And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.</verse>
    <verse value="9">And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.</verse>
    <verse value="10">For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.</verse>
    <verse value="11">And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.</verse>
    <verse value="12">And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.</verse>
    <verse value="13">And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him.</verse>
    <verse value="14">And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,</verse>
    <verse value="15">And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:</verse>
    <verse value="16">And Simon he surnamed Peter;</verse>
    <verse value="17">And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:</verse>
    <verse value="18">And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,</verse>
    <verse value="19">And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.</verse>
    <verse value="20">And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</verse>
    <verse value="21">And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.</verse>
    <verse value="22">And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.</verse>
    <verse value="23">And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
    <verse value="24">And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</verse>
    <verse value="25">And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</verse>
    <verse value="26">And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.</verse>
    <verse value="27">No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.</verse>
    <verse value="28">Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:</verse>
    <verse value="29">But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:</verse>
    <verse value="30">Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.</verse>
    <verse value="31">There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.</verse>
    <verse value="32">And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.</verse>
    <verse value="33">And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?</verse>
    <verse value="34">And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!</verse>
    <verse value="35">For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.</verse>
