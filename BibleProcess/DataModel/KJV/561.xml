    <verse value="1">&lt;A Song or Psalm of Asaph.&gt; Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.</verse>
    <verse value="2">For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.</verse>
    <verse value="3">They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.</verse>
    <verse value="4">They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.</verse>
    <verse value="5">For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:</verse>
    <verse value="6">The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;</verse>
    <verse value="7">Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;</verse>
    <verse value="8">Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.</verse>
    <verse value="9">Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:</verse>
    <verse value="10">Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="11">Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:</verse>
    <verse value="12">Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.</verse>
    <verse value="13">O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.</verse>
    <verse value="14">As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;</verse>
    <verse value="15">So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.</verse>
    <verse value="16">Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.</verse>
    <verse value="17">Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:</verse>
    <verse value="18">That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.</verse>
