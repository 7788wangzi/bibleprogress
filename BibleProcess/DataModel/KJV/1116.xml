    <verse value="1">But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.</verse>
    <verse value="2">For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.</verse>
    <verse value="3">For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.</verse>
    <verse value="4">But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.</verse>
    <verse value="5">Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.</verse>
    <verse value="6">Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.</verse>
    <verse value="7">For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.</verse>
    <verse value="8">But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.</verse>
    <verse value="9">For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
    <verse value="10">Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</verse>
    <verse value="11">Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.</verse>
    <verse value="12">And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;</verse>
    <verse value="13">And to esteem them very highly in love for their work\'s sake. And be at peace among yourselves.</verse>
    <verse value="14">Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.</verse>
    <verse value="15">See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.</verse>
    <verse value="16">Rejoice evermore.</verse>
    <verse value="17">Pray without ceasing.</verse>
    <verse value="18">In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.</verse>
    <verse value="19">Quench not the Spirit.</verse>
    <verse value="20">Despise not prophesyings.</verse>
    <verse value="21">Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</verse>
    <verse value="22">Abstain from all appearance of evil.</verse>
    <verse value="23">And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
    <verse value="24">Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.</verse>
    <verse value="25">Brethren, pray for us.</verse>
    <verse value="26">Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.</verse>
    <verse value="27">I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.</verse>
    <verse value="28">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. &lt;The first epistle to the Thessalonians was written from Athens.&gt;</verse>
