    <verse value="1">&lt;To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, the servant of the LORD, who spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said,&gt; I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.</verse>
    <verse value="2">The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.</verse>
    <verse value="3">I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</verse>
    <verse value="4">The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</verse>
    <verse value="5">The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.</verse>
    <verse value="6">In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.</verse>
    <verse value="7">Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.</verse>
    <verse value="8">There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</verse>
    <verse value="9">He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.</verse>
    <verse value="10">And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.</verse>
    <verse value="11">He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</verse>
    <verse value="12">At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.</verse>
    <verse value="13">The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.</verse>
    <verse value="14">Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.</verse>
    <verse value="15">Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</verse>
    <verse value="16">He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</verse>
    <verse value="17">He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.</verse>
    <verse value="18">They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</verse>
    <verse value="19">He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</verse>
    <verse value="20">The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</verse>
    <verse value="21">For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</verse>
    <verse value="22">For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.</verse>
    <verse value="23">I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.</verse>
    <verse value="24">Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</verse>
    <verse value="25">With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;</verse>
    <verse value="26">With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.</verse>
    <verse value="27">For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.</verse>
    <verse value="28">For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.</verse>
    <verse value="29">For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.</verse>
    <verse value="30">As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.</verse>
    <verse value="31">For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?</verse>
    <verse value="32">It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.</verse>
    <verse value="33">He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.</verse>
    <verse value="34">He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</verse>
    <verse value="35">Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.</verse>
    <verse value="36">Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.</verse>
    <verse value="37">I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.</verse>
    <verse value="38">I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.</verse>
    <verse value="39">For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</verse>
    <verse value="40">Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.</verse>
    <verse value="41">They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</verse>
    <verse value="42">Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.</verse>
    <verse value="43">Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.</verse>
    <verse value="44">As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.</verse>
    <verse value="45">The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.</verse>
    <verse value="46">The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.</verse>
    <verse value="47">It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.</verse>
    <verse value="48">He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</verse>
    <verse value="49">Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.</verse>
    <verse value="50">Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.</verse>
