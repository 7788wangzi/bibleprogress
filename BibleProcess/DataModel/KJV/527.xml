    <verse value="1">&lt;To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.&gt; Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:</verse>
    <verse value="2">Both low and high, rich and poor, together.</verse>
    <verse value="3">My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.</verse>
    <verse value="4">I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.</verse>
    <verse value="5">Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?</verse>
    <verse value="6">They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;</verse>
    <verse value="7">None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:</verse>
    <verse value="8">(For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)</verse>
    <verse value="9">That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.</verse>
    <verse value="10">For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.</verse>
    <verse value="11">Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.</verse>
    <verse value="12">Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.</verse>
    <verse value="13">This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.</verse>
    <verse value="14">Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.</verse>
    <verse value="15">But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.</verse>
    <verse value="16">Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;</verse>
    <verse value="17">For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.</verse>
    <verse value="18">Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.</verse>
    <verse value="19">He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.</verse>
    <verse value="20">Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.</verse>
