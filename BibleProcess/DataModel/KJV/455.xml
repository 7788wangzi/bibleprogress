    <verse value="1">Then Job answered and said,</verse>
    <verse value="2">How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?</verse>
    <verse value="3">These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.</verse>
    <verse value="4">And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.</verse>
    <verse value="5">If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:</verse>
    <verse value="6">Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.</verse>
    <verse value="7">Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.</verse>
    <verse value="8">He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.</verse>
    <verse value="9">He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.</verse>
    <verse value="10">He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.</verse>
    <verse value="11">He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.</verse>
    <verse value="12">His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.</verse>
    <verse value="13">He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.</verse>
    <verse value="14">My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.</verse>
    <verse value="15">They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.</verse>
    <verse value="16">I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.</verse>
    <verse value="17">My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children\'s sake of mine own body.</verse>
    <verse value="18">Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.</verse>
    <verse value="19">All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.</verse>
    <verse value="20">My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.</verse>
    <verse value="21">Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.</verse>
    <verse value="22">Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?</verse>
    <verse value="23">Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!</verse>
    <verse value="24">That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!</verse>
    <verse value="25">For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:</verse>
    <verse value="26">And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:</verse>
    <verse value="27">Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.</verse>
    <verse value="28">But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?</verse>
    <verse value="29">Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.</verse>
