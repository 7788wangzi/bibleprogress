    <verse value="1">Furthermore Elihu answered and said,</verse>
    <verse value="2">Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</verse>
    <verse value="3">For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.</verse>
    <verse value="4">Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.</verse>
    <verse value="5">For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.</verse>
    <verse value="6">Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.</verse>
    <verse value="7">What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?</verse>
    <verse value="8">Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</verse>
    <verse value="9">For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.</verse>
    <verse value="10">Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</verse>
    <verse value="11">For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.</verse>
    <verse value="12">Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</verse>
    <verse value="13">Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?</verse>
    <verse value="14">If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</verse>
    <verse value="15">All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.</verse>
    <verse value="16">If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.</verse>
    <verse value="17">Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?</verse>
    <verse value="18">Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?</verse>
    <verse value="19">How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.</verse>
    <verse value="20">In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.</verse>
    <verse value="21">For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.</verse>
    <verse value="22">There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</verse>
    <verse value="23">For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.</verse>
    <verse value="24">He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.</verse>
    <verse value="25">Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</verse>
    <verse value="26">He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</verse>
    <verse value="27">Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:</verse>
    <verse value="28">So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</verse>
    <verse value="29">When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:</verse>
    <verse value="30">That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.</verse>
    <verse value="31">Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:</verse>
    <verse value="32">That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</verse>
    <verse value="33">Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.</verse>
    <verse value="34">Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.</verse>
    <verse value="35">Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.</verse>
    <verse value="36">My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.</verse>
    <verse value="37">For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</verse>
