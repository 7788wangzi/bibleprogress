    <verse value="1">Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?</verse>
    <verse value="2">She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.</verse>
    <verse value="3">She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.</verse>
    <verse value="4">Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.</verse>
    <verse value="5">O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.</verse>
    <verse value="6">Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.</verse>
    <verse value="7">For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</verse>
    <verse value="8">All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them.</verse>
    <verse value="9">They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.</verse>
    <verse value="10">Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.</verse>
    <verse value="11">For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.</verse>
    <verse value="12">I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.</verse>
    <verse value="13">The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.</verse>
    <verse value="14">Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.</verse>
    <verse value="15">By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.</verse>
    <verse value="16">By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="17">I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.</verse>
    <verse value="18">Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.</verse>
    <verse value="19">My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.</verse>
    <verse value="20">I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:</verse>
    <verse value="21">That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.</verse>
    <verse value="22">The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.</verse>
    <verse value="23">I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</verse>
    <verse value="24">When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.</verse>
    <verse value="25">Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:</verse>
    <verse value="26">While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.</verse>
    <verse value="27">When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:</verse>
    <verse value="28">When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:</verse>
    <verse value="29">When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:</verse>
    <verse value="30">Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;</verse>
    <verse value="31">Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.</verse>
    <verse value="32">Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.</verse>
    <verse value="33">Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.</verse>
    <verse value="34">Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.</verse>
    <verse value="35">For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse value="36">But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.</verse>
