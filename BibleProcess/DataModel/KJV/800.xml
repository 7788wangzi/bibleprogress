    <verse value="1">I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.</verse>
    <verse value="2">He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.</verse>
    <verse value="3">Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all the day.</verse>
    <verse value="4">My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.</verse>
    <verse value="5">He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.</verse>
    <verse value="6">He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.</verse>
    <verse value="7">He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.</verse>
    <verse value="8">Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.</verse>
    <verse value="9">He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.</verse>
    <verse value="10">He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places.</verse>
    <verse value="11">He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.</verse>
    <verse value="12">He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.</verse>
    <verse value="13">He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.</verse>
    <verse value="14">I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.</verse>
    <verse value="15">He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.</verse>
    <verse value="16">He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.</verse>
    <verse value="17">And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.</verse>
    <verse value="18">And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:</verse>
    <verse value="19">Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.</verse>
    <verse value="20">My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.</verse>
    <verse value="21">This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.</verse>
    <verse value="22">It is of the LORD\'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.</verse>
    <verse value="23">They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.</verse>
    <verse value="24">The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.</verse>
    <verse value="25">The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.</verse>
    <verse value="26">It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse value="27">It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.</verse>
    <verse value="28">He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him.</verse>
    <verse value="29">He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.</verse>
    <verse value="30">He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.</verse>
    <verse value="31">For the Lord will not cast off for ever:</verse>
    <verse value="32">But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.</verse>
    <verse value="33">For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.</verse>
    <verse value="34">To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,</verse>
    <verse value="35">To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,</verse>
    <verse value="36">To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.</verse>
    <verse value="37">Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?</verse>
    <verse value="38">Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?</verse>
    <verse value="39">Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?</verse>
    <verse value="40">Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.</verse>
    <verse value="41">Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.</verse>
    <verse value="42">We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.</verse>
    <verse value="43">Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.</verse>
    <verse value="44">Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through.</verse>
    <verse value="45">Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.</verse>
    <verse value="46">All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.</verse>
    <verse value="47">Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.</verse>
    <verse value="48">Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</verse>
    <verse value="49">Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,</verse>
    <verse value="50">Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.</verse>
    <verse value="51">Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city.</verse>
    <verse value="52">Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.</verse>
    <verse value="53">They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.</verse>
    <verse value="54">Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.</verse>
    <verse value="55">I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.</verse>
    <verse value="56">Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.</verse>
    <verse value="57">Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.</verse>
    <verse value="58">O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.</verse>
    <verse value="59">O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.</verse>
    <verse value="60">Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me.</verse>
    <verse value="61">Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me;</verse>
    <verse value="62">The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.</verse>
    <verse value="63">Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their musick.</verse>
    <verse value="64">Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.</verse>
    <verse value="65">Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.</verse>
    <verse value="66">Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.</verse>
