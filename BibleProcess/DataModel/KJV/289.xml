    <verse value="1">And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:</verse>
    <verse value="2">And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;</verse>
    <verse value="3">The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.</verse>
    <verse value="4">I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</verse>
    <verse value="5">When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;</verse>
    <verse value="6">The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;</verse>
    <verse value="7">In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.</verse>
    <verse value="8">Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.</verse>
    <verse value="9">There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</verse>
    <verse value="10">He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet.</verse>
    <verse value="11">And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.</verse>
    <verse value="12">And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.</verse>
    <verse value="13">Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.</verse>
    <verse value="14">The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.</verse>
    <verse value="15">And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.</verse>
    <verse value="16">And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</verse>
    <verse value="17">He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;</verse>
    <verse value="18">He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.</verse>
    <verse value="19">They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</verse>
    <verse value="20">He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</verse>
    <verse value="21">The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</verse>
    <verse value="22">For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</verse>
    <verse value="23">For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.</verse>
    <verse value="24">I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.</verse>
    <verse value="25">Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.</verse>
    <verse value="26">With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.</verse>
    <verse value="27">With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.</verse>
    <verse value="28">And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.</verse>
    <verse value="29">For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.</verse>
    <verse value="30">For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.</verse>
    <verse value="31">As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.</verse>
    <verse value="32">For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?</verse>
    <verse value="33">God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.</verse>
    <verse value="34">He maketh my feet like hinds\' feet: and setteth me upon my high places.</verse>
    <verse value="35">He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</verse>
    <verse value="36">Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.</verse>
    <verse value="37">Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.</verse>
    <verse value="38">I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.</verse>
    <verse value="39">And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.</verse>
    <verse value="40">For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.</verse>
    <verse value="41">Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.</verse>
    <verse value="42">They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</verse>
    <verse value="43">Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.</verse>
    <verse value="44">Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.</verse>
    <verse value="45">Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.</verse>
    <verse value="46">Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.</verse>
    <verse value="47">The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.</verse>
    <verse value="48">It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,</verse>
    <verse value="49">And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</verse>
    <verse value="50">Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.</verse>
    <verse value="51">He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.</verse>
