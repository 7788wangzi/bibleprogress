    <verse value="1">And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.</verse>
    <verse value="2">And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.</verse>
    <verse value="3">And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:</verse>
    <verse value="4">For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.</verse>
    <verse value="5">And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,</verse>
    <verse value="6">As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</verse>
    <verse value="7">And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?</verse>
    <verse value="8">And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them.</verse>
    <verse value="9">But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.</verse>
    <verse value="10">Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:</verse>
    <verse value="11">And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.</verse>
    <verse value="12">But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name\'s sake.</verse>
    <verse value="13">And it shall turn to you for a testimony.</verse>
    <verse value="14">Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer:</verse>
    <verse value="15">For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.</verse>
    <verse value="16">And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death.</verse>
    <verse value="17">And ye shall be hated of all men for my name\'s sake.</verse>
    <verse value="18">But there shall not an hair of your head perish.</verse>
    <verse value="19">In your patience possess ye your souls.</verse>
    <verse value="20">And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.</verse>
    <verse value="21">Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.</verse>
    <verse value="22">For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.</verse>
    <verse value="23">But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.</verse>
    <verse value="24">And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.</verse>
    <verse value="25">And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;</verse>
    <verse value="26">Men\'s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.</verse>
    <verse value="27">And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</verse>
    <verse value="28">And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.</verse>
    <verse value="29">And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;</verse>
    <verse value="30">When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand.</verse>
    <verse value="31">So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.</verse>
    <verse value="32">Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.</verse>
    <verse value="33">Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.</verse>
    <verse value="34">And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.</verse>
    <verse value="35">For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.</verse>
    <verse value="36">Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.</verse>
    <verse value="37">And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives.</verse>
    <verse value="38">And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.</verse>
