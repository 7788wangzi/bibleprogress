    <verse value="1">Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them.</verse>
    <verse value="2">For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief.</verse>
    <verse value="3">Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established:</verse>
    <verse value="4">And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.</verse>
    <verse value="5">A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.</verse>
    <verse value="6">For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors there is safety.</verse>
    <verse value="7">Wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate.</verse>
    <verse value="8">He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.</verse>
    <verse value="9">The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is an abomination to men.</verse>
    <verse value="10">If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.</verse>
    <verse value="11">If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain;</verse>
    <verse value="12">If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it? and shall not he render to every man according to his works?</verse>
    <verse value="13">My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste:</verse>
    <verse value="14">So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thou hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off.</verse>
    <verse value="15">Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:</verse>
    <verse value="16">For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.</verse>
    <verse value="17">Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:</verse>
    <verse value="18">Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.</verse>
    <verse value="19">Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious at the wicked;</verse>
    <verse value="20">For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of the wicked shall be put out.</verse>
    <verse value="21">My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not with them that are given to change:</verse>
    <verse value="22">For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?</verse>
    <verse value="23">These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment.</verse>
    <verse value="24">He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:</verse>
    <verse value="25">But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.</verse>
    <verse value="26">Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.</verse>
    <verse value="27">Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.</verse>
    <verse value="28">Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive not with thy lips.</verse>
    <verse value="29">Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.</verse>
    <verse value="30">I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;</verse>
    <verse value="31">And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.</verse>
    <verse value="32">Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction.</verse>
    <verse value="33">Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</verse>
    <verse value="34">So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.</verse>
