    <verse value="1">Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</verse>
    <verse value="2">Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</verse>
    <verse value="3">For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</verse>
    <verse value="4">Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.</verse>
    <verse value="5">For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.</verse>
    <verse value="6">For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.</verse>
    <verse value="7">Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?</verse>
    <verse value="8">This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.</verse>
    <verse value="9">A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</verse>
    <verse value="10">I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.</verse>
    <verse value="11">And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.</verse>
    <verse value="12">I would they were even cut off which trouble you.</verse>
    <verse value="13">For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</verse>
    <verse value="14">For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</verse>
    <verse value="15">But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.</verse>
    <verse value="16">This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.</verse>
    <verse value="17">For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</verse>
    <verse value="18">But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</verse>
    <verse value="19">Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</verse>
    <verse value="20">Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,</verse>
    <verse value="21">Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
    <verse value="22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,</verse>
    <verse value="23">Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</verse>
    <verse value="24">And they that are Christ\'s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.</verse>
    <verse value="25">If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</verse>
    <verse value="26">Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.</verse>
