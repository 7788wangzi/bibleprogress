    <verse value="1">Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,</verse>
    <verse value="2">As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;</verse>
    <verse value="3">All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;</verse>
    <verse value="4">My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.</verse>
    <verse value="5">God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.</verse>
    <verse value="6">My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.</verse>
    <verse value="7">Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.</verse>
    <verse value="8">For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?</verse>
    <verse value="9">Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?</verse>
    <verse value="10">Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?</verse>
    <verse value="11">I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.</verse>
    <verse value="12">Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain?</verse>
    <verse value="13">This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.</verse>
    <verse value="14">If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.</verse>
    <verse value="15">Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.</verse>
    <verse value="16">Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;</verse>
    <verse value="17">He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.</verse>
    <verse value="18">He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh.</verse>
    <verse value="19">The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not.</verse>
    <verse value="20">Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.</verse>
    <verse value="21">The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.</verse>
    <verse value="22">For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.</verse>
    <verse value="23">Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.</verse>
