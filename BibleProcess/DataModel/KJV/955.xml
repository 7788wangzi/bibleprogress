    <verse value="1">And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,</verse>
    <verse value="2">Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</verse>
    <verse value="3">Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</verse>
    <verse value="4">And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.</verse>
    <verse value="5">But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.</verse>
    <verse value="6">Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</verse>
    <verse value="7">There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.</verse>
    <verse value="8">But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?</verse>
    <verse value="9">For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</verse>
    <verse value="10">When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</verse>
    <verse value="11">For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</verse>
    <verse value="12">For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.</verse>
    <verse value="13">Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</verse>
    <verse value="14">Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</verse>
    <verse value="15">And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</verse>
    <verse value="16">And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</verse>
    <verse value="17">Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</verse>
    <verse value="18">And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</verse>
    <verse value="19">And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</verse>
    <verse value="20">Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</verse>
    <verse value="21">And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</verse>
    <verse value="22">And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</verse>
    <verse value="23">And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</verse>
    <verse value="24">The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</verse>
    <verse value="25">Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.</verse>
    <verse value="26">And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</verse>
    <verse value="27">And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</verse>
    <verse value="28">For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</verse>
    <verse value="29">But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</verse>
    <verse value="30">And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</verse>
    <verse value="31">Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</verse>
    <verse value="32">But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</verse>
    <verse value="33">Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.</verse>
    <verse value="34">Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</verse>
    <verse value="35">Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</verse>
    <verse value="36">Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</verse>
    <verse value="37">And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</verse>
    <verse value="38">Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</verse>
    <verse value="39">And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</verse>
    <verse value="40">And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</verse>
    <verse value="41">Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</verse>
    <verse value="42">He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</verse>
    <verse value="43">And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
    <verse value="44">And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</verse>
    <verse value="45">Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
    <verse value="46">Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</verse>
    <verse value="47">And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</verse>
    <verse value="48">Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</verse>
    <verse value="49">And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</verse>
    <verse value="50">And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</verse>
    <verse value="51">And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.</verse>
    <verse value="52">Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</verse>
    <verse value="53">Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
    <verse value="54">But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</verse>
    <verse value="55">In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</verse>
    <verse value="56">But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</verse>
    <verse value="57">And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</verse>
    <verse value="58">But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</verse>
    <verse value="59">Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</verse>
    <verse value="60">But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</verse>
    <verse value="61">And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</verse>
    <verse value="62">And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</verse>
    <verse value="63">But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
    <verse value="64">Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</verse>
    <verse value="65">Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</verse>
    <verse value="66">What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</verse>
    <verse value="67">Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,</verse>
    <verse value="68">Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</verse>
    <verse value="69">Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</verse>
    <verse value="70">But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</verse>
    <verse value="71">And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
    <verse value="72">And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</verse>
    <verse value="73">And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.</verse>
    <verse value="74">Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</verse>
    <verse value="75">And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</verse>
