    <verse value="16">She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers: her labour is in vain without fear;</verse>
    <verse value="17">Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.</verse>

    <verse value="29">From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.</verse>
    <verse value="30">Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.</verse>
