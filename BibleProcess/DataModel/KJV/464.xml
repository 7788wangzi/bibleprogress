    <verse value="1">Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it.</verse>
    <verse value="2">Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone.</verse>
    <verse value="3">He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.</verse>
    <verse value="4">The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.</verse>
    <verse value="5">As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.</verse>
    <verse value="6">The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.</verse>
    <verse value="7">There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture\'s eye hath not seen:</verse>
    <verse value="8">The lion\'s whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.</verse>
    <verse value="9">He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.</verse>
    <verse value="10">He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.</verse>
    <verse value="11">He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.</verse>
    <verse value="12">But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?</verse>
    <verse value="13">Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.</verse>
    <verse value="14">The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.</verse>
    <verse value="15">It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.</verse>
    <verse value="16">It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.</verse>
    <verse value="17">The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.</verse>
    <verse value="18">No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies.</verse>
    <verse value="19">The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.</verse>
    <verse value="20">Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?</verse>
    <verse value="21">Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.</verse>
    <verse value="22">Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.</verse>
    <verse value="23">God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.</verse>
    <verse value="24">For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven;</verse>
    <verse value="25">To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.</verse>
    <verse value="26">When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:</verse>
    <verse value="27">Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.</verse>
    <verse value="28">And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.</verse>
