    <verse value="29">And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me.</verse>
    <verse value="30">For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?</verse>

    <verse value="32">I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.</verse>
    <verse value="33">So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.</verse>
    <verse value="34">And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.</verse>
    <verse value="35">And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.</verse>
    <verse value="36">And he set three days\' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban\'s flocks.</verse>
    <verse value="37">And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.</verse>
    <verse value="38">And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.</verse>
    <verse value="39">And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.</verse>
    <verse value="40">And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban\'s cattle.</verse>
    <verse value="41">And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.</verse>
    <verse value="42">But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban\'s, and the stronger Jacob\'s.</verse>
    <verse value="43">And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.</verse>
