    <verse value="1">When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before thee:</verse>
    <verse value="2">And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite.</verse>
    <verse value="3">Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat.</verse>
    <verse value="4">Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.</verse>
    <verse value="5">Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.</verse>
    <verse value="6">Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:</verse>
    <verse value="7">For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee.</verse>
    <verse value="8">The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.</verse>
    <verse value="9">Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.</verse>
    <verse value="10">Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:</verse>
    <verse value="11">For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee.</verse>
    <verse value="12">Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.</verse>
    <verse value="13">Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.</verse>
    <verse value="14">Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.</verse>
    <verse value="15">My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.</verse>
    <verse value="15">My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.</verse>
    <verse value="16">Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.</verse>
    <verse value="17">Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the LORD all the day long.</verse>
    <verse value="18">For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off.</verse>
    <verse value="19">Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.</verse>
    <verse value="20">Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:</verse>
    <verse value="21">For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.</verse>
    <verse value="22">Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.</verse>
    <verse value="23">Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.</verse>
    <verse value="24">The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.</verse>
    <verse value="25">Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.</verse>
    <verse value="26">My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.</verse>
    <verse value="27">For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit.</verse>
    <verse value="28">She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men.</verse>
    <verse value="29">Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?</verse>
    <verse value="30">They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.</verse>
    <verse value="31">Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.</verse>
    <verse value="32">At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.</verse>
    <verse value="33">Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.</verse>
    <verse value="34">Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.</verse>
    <verse value="35">They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.</verse>
