    <verse value="1">&lt;A Prayer of David.&gt; Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.</verse>
    <verse value="2">Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.</verse>
    <verse value="3">Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.</verse>
    <verse value="4">Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.</verse>
    <verse value="5">Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.</verse>
    <verse value="6">I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.</verse>
    <verse value="7">Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them.</verse>
    <verse value="8">Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,</verse>
    <verse value="9">From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about.</verse>
    <verse value="10">They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.</verse>
    <verse value="11">They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;</verse>
    <verse value="12">Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.</verse>
    <verse value="13">Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword:</verse>
    <verse value="14">From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.</verse>
    <verse value="15">As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.</verse>
