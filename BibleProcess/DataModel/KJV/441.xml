    <verse value="1">Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?</verse>
    <verse value="2">For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.</verse>
    <verse value="3">I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</verse>
    <verse value="4">His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.</verse>
    <verse value="5">Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.</verse>
    <verse value="6">Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;</verse>
    <verse value="7">Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</verse>
    <verse value="8">I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:</verse>
    <verse value="9">Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:</verse>
    <verse value="10">Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:</verse>
    <verse value="11">To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.</verse>
    <verse value="12">He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.</verse>
    <verse value="13">He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.</verse>
    <verse value="14">They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.</verse>
    <verse value="15">But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.</verse>
    <verse value="16">So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</verse>
    <verse value="17">Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:</verse>
    <verse value="18">For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.</verse>
    <verse value="19">He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</verse>
    <verse value="20">In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.</verse>
    <verse value="21">Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</verse>
    <verse value="22">At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="23">For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</verse>
    <verse value="24">And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.</verse>
    <verse value="25">Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</verse>
    <verse value="26">Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.</verse>
    <verse value="27">Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.</verse>
