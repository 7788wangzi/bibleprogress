    <verse value="1">The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</verse>
    <verse value="2">Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;</verse>
    <verse value="3">And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;</verse>
    <verse value="4">And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;</verse>
    <verse value="5">And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;</verse>
    <verse value="6">And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;</verse>
    <verse value="7">And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;</verse>
    <verse value="8">And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;</verse>
    <verse value="9">And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;</verse>
    <verse value="10">And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;</verse>
    <verse value="11">And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:</verse>
    <verse value="12">And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;</verse>
    <verse value="13">And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;</verse>
    <verse value="14">And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;</verse>
    <verse value="15">And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;</verse>
    <verse value="16">And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</verse>
    <verse value="17">So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.</verse>
    <verse value="18">Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
    <verse value="19">Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.</verse>
    <verse value="20">But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
    <verse value="21">And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.</verse>
    <verse value="22">Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,</verse>
    <verse value="23">Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</verse>
    <verse value="24">Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</verse>
    <verse value="25">And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.</verse>
