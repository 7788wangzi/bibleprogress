    <verse value="1">O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</verse>
    <verse value="2">Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;</verse>
    <verse value="3">And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.</verse>
    <verse value="4">They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.</verse>
    <verse value="5">Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</verse>
    <verse value="6">Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.</verse>
    <verse value="7">And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.</verse>
    <verse value="8">Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</verse>
    <verse value="9">For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.</verse>
    <verse value="10">Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;</verse>
    <verse value="11">Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:</verse>
    <verse value="12">Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.</verse>
    <verse value="13">Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.</verse>
    <verse value="14">He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.</verse>
    <verse value="15">Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</verse>
    <verse value="16">For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.</verse>
    <verse value="17">Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</verse>
    <verse value="18">Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.</verse>
    <verse value="19">Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses.</verse>
    <verse value="20">He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.</verse>
    <verse value="21">Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</verse>
    <verse value="22">And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.</verse>
    <verse value="23">They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;</verse>
    <verse value="24">These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.</verse>
    <verse value="25">For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.</verse>
    <verse value="26">They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.</verse>
    <verse value="27">They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end.</verse>
    <verse value="28">Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.</verse>
    <verse value="29">He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.</verse>
    <verse value="30">Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.</verse>
    <verse value="31">Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</verse>
    <verse value="32">Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</verse>
    <verse value="33">He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;</verse>
    <verse value="34">A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</verse>
    <verse value="35">He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.</verse>
    <verse value="36">And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;</verse>
    <verse value="37">And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.</verse>
    <verse value="38">He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.</verse>
    <verse value="39">Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.</verse>
    <verse value="40">He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.</verse>
    <verse value="41">Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.</verse>
    <verse value="42">The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.</verse>
    <verse value="43">Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.</verse>
