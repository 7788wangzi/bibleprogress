    <verse value="1">My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;</verse>
    <verse value="2">So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;</verse>
    <verse value="3">Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;</verse>
    <verse value="4">If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;</verse>
    <verse value="5">Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.</verse>
    <verse value="6">For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.</verse>
    <verse value="7">He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.</verse>
    <verse value="8">He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.</verse>
    <verse value="9">Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.</verse>
    <verse value="10">When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;</verse>
    <verse value="11">Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:</verse>
    <verse value="12">To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things;</verse>
    <verse value="13">Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</verse>
    <verse value="14">Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;</verse>
    <verse value="15">Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:</verse>
    <verse value="16">To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;</verse>
    <verse value="17">Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</verse>
    <verse value="18">For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.</verse>
    <verse value="19">None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.</verse>
    <verse value="20">That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</verse>
    <verse value="21">For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</verse>
    <verse value="22">But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.</verse>
